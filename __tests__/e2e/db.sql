I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today, folks, in our podcast, I am joined by a couple of special guests. I know it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve had a guest, so I&#8217;m very excited to introduce you to who I have with me today. Today, I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onemaggie/\">Maggie Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jffng/\">Jeff Ong</a>. They both are working on themes, and especially the future of themes as we move into this low code, no code block based experience of editing things in WordPress. And there have been so many questions lately about what does the landscape of being a theme developer turns into once we move fully into this excellent promise of user empowerment for Gutenberg? I figured who best to come and talk to us about that than these two. So welcome, Maggie. Welcome, Jeff. I&#8217;m really excited to have this conversation with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>01:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having us. Excited to be here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just gonna hop right in, and we will see what happens. The first thing that I want to chat about, I hear so many questions and so much discussion about patterns in a lot of different places. Like obviously, the work that I helped to steward the most is around like the Block Pattern directory and various other user-facing tools. And so I have never really been able to give a really solid answer about like patterns and how they work inside themes. And so I wondered if you all had anything that you could offer to our listeners to help clarify what is the power of patterns inside themes in the future? Implementation of themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>02:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can try to start unless, Maggie? Okay. Well, if you take a look at what I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of months working on Twenty Twenty-Two. And if you look at that theme, it&#8217;s mostly just the collection of patterns. Patterns. As you know, if you read the description, the theme, it&#8217;s designed to be the most flexible and kind of like flexible theme ever, dare I say ever created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can dare to say it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>03:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I think a huge part of that is because of the Full Site Editing being launched, introduced in 5.9. And also that theme itself ships with all of these patterns in it that work with the overall design, but really can be configured to your own kind of unique liking and kind of taste and ultimately, what you want to accomplish, whether that&#8217;s I want to make a portfolio, I want to make, you know, a single-page website promoting like my podcast, or there are patterns for that kind of shipping with the theme. And they&#8217;ve all been kind of designed and tailored to work with the typography choices at a baseline level with the color choices at a baseline level, but can very easily be tweaked. And you can kind of rely on them to work with the editor. And I guess, kind of zooming out for a little bit, not just about Twenty-Twenty Two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like patterns as this idea that a theme, hopefully, what it is, it&#8217;s a collection of different design options or layout options that are ultimately presented as patterns to the user, the patterns are just a really easy way to basically say &#8220;I want you this layout, like two columns of text or with like some images here.&#8221; Basically, a theme becomes a way of packaging the patterns together in a way that feels like a coherent piece of a coherent website. And I think that&#8217;s a pretty powerful idea. I know that the patterns directory is also opening up making those patterns pretty widely available. But I think a theme you could think of as like a curation of those patterns in a way that makes sense. And I think Twenty-Twenty Two is a really good example. I mean, I&#8217;m biased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s a good example. Maggie, did you have anything that you wanted to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>05:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, What I really like about patterns is how it empowers the user, even if they don&#8217;t really have like a deep knowledge of code, or they&#8217;re not used to the more complex blocks. When the theme developer gives you this pattern about using the query block, for example, it lays out your posts in a very compelling manner. And you can edit it if you want it or just use it out of the box. And you have this dynamic blog that it&#8217;s, like, such a big important part of your website. Like if you want to have a page where you have, you have maybe a podcast website, and you want to showcase your podcasts differently than your regular blog posts. So you can use a different gray pattern for that. And it&#8217;s like, really, really easy to use, even if you&#8217;re not familiar with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have found compelling about this new version of themes and kind of the way that themes are planning to look in the future; it&#8217;s going to be like a super throwback, so everyone get ready for me to sound old, my guests and my listeners alike. It reminds me of my original days of blogging on the web. I was not a developer and even though I had this really short stint of working with JavaScript in my career, at some point. Like no one actually would ever look to me and be like, that one is excellent at design and fixing everything with code, like I was just killer at searching for the right pieces of code, right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I remember sitting there on Zynga, which is, of course, now powered by WordPress, I absolutely just went out and found bundles of code that are now what we would consider themes and modified the small pieces that I needed to change in order to like really suit what I wanted to have happen on the site at the time. And they&#8217;re like, I knew I could break it all. Really easily. But also, it was, it was not scary to think about breaking it. Like it was clear how I could fix it if I really broke it. The content, like what I had written, was separate from everything to do with the way that it was looking. And so like, I wouldn&#8217;t destroy all of my work, just because I didn&#8217;t put a semicolon in the right place, or whatever it was in that moment. And so like, this future of themes really reminds me of this a lot where someone has curated how it can look how it should look. And you can just like add in modular pieces that will augment what was already intended, but still kind of work. And if it&#8217;s not gonna work, it&#8217;s kind of easy to fix too. So like, I&#8217;m excited. That was a really exciting time in my learning of the web and certainly was formative in my career, as we all now see. And so yeah, I think that&#8217;s really exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have actually another question that this conversation has kind of brought up for me. I have, obviously just use the term modular, which no one has ever used in the context of themes for WordPress. And I know that there is a lot there are a lot of terms kind of wandering around about themes right now. And especially as we&#8217;re moving into what themes can look like in the future. There was block based theme as a term for a while. And now it&#8217;s block themes. There was like this floating around the term, universal themes. And now we&#8217;re looking at just like block themes forever. And so I wondered if y&#8217;all could give us a just like a clear understanding of these terms that had been being used and maybe are going out of fashion? Like, are they important for us to keep knowing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, the history of terms around themes. And obviously, even my knowledge only goes back so far. But it was around when we started doing the block based themes meeting. And trying to I think that&#8217;s where that term kind of came from is like, oh, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start talking about this idea that themes can be completely made up out of blocks. And what does that mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think over time, it wasn&#8217;t just block themes, because, you know, previously, there were themes and even default themes that used and took into account the fact that blocks existed. So there was some confusion there. Enough time has gone on where we focus on this idea that themes whose templates are ultimately made out of blocks are block themes. And to me, it&#8217;s kind of as simple as that. Its themes that supply a set of templates that previously in the past were a collection of PHP and various template tags and whatnot is all transitioned to themes made up including other blocks, as well as themes that supply styles through theme.json configuration instead of supplying it in raw CSS. To me this idea is really crystallizing around like this is a block theme, one that is really, at its core, supplying a set of templates, and styles through a language that WordPress understands natively, and can allow it to be configured and customized in a really powerful way. And then maybe someday in the future, they&#8217;ll just be called themes again. If we do a good enough they will just be called themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m gonna take us into a philosophical area now that you&#8217;ve just put us in there. You said, someday they&#8217;ll be called Themes. Again, I&#8217;ve talked about this on this podcast a few times. And for anyone who&#8217;s worked with me for any length of time, like you all probably heard this from me as well. But like, adjectives are so frequently the realm of things that are not what you expect, right? Because like you have coffee, and then decaf coffee, no one&#8217;s like caffeinated coffee, because that&#8217;s what you expect out of it. And so when you&#8217;re like themes, and block themes, it makes it look like block themes are secondary, which at the moment, they are, ish. But in the future, I think you&#8217;re probably right, there will be a time when the modifier isn&#8217;t necessary anymore because it will be hopefully a much better way for people to kind of change the way that their themes work and make it more usable for users and people who are, you know, having to manage their own site without necessarily wanting to or being able to, like, have a Maggie in the room to fix everything that they break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie is nowhere near me. And so she&#8217;s never been in the room when I&#8217;ve broken anything. But I believe that Maggie on one occasion, at least, has come in and helped me fix something that I definitely broke. I&#8217;m an excellent breaker of WordPress things. Maggie, did you have anything you wanted to add to that question? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess, maybe clarify a bit, what universal themes are because, yeah, maybe some people have heard about the term but they don&#8217;t really know what they are. And maybe just clarify that. The term was born when developing block themes wasn&#8217;t something that you could actually do for production websites like you could build them to test some experiments, but they weren&#8217;t really ready for users to use. So universal themes want to grasp the power of love themes while still being ready for users. So the way they do it is they are block based, like we used to call them in the sense that the templates are made of blocks. But they are also able to be customized using the customizer, which is the old way of customizing themes, instead of using the site editor. So they can have a balance between two worlds between the worlds of classic themes and block themes. But they are, at heart, a temporary concept. They are bound to be blocked themes in the future, but with maybe a foot in the past, where they can actually serve users who are not ready for full-on site editor. But they are bound to be full block themes in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a really interesting concept in there. So universal themes, it sounds like are basically kind of like an on-ramp for people who are not really ready to fully commit to this for any number of reasons. Like we never want to say that we know the reason that people would be a little bit shy to get started with this. But like it&#8217;s kind of like an on-ramp, it&#8217;s a safe way to get back to something that they do know, in the event that what they don&#8217;t know, really hinders their progress makes it hard for them to get the work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I wouldn&#8217;t say that they are for people shyer to get into new stuff rather than developers who want to embrace the new stuff before it&#8217;s even really ready. They really want to embrace the power of the blocks instead of doing things the old way. But even if it&#8217;s not fully ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>14:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They still need to support the old way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like being backward compatible and being ready for any kind of user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly for developers, everyone who heard me just talking about how it was a great thing for users, ignore it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>15:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also good for users; If they feel secure in using the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think that there&#8217;s something important here that we certainly learned with the adoption of Gutenberg in 5.0. Right, which is that there is certainly one method of helping people to adopt things, which is to go like the art of war style, and kind of smash their rice pots and burn all their boats, like, that&#8217;s one way. Which works for a lot of companies in the world, I&#8217;m sure. But WordPress has always had kind of a commitment, not even kind of, has always had a commitment to backward compatibility. And like, we know that a lot of the work on Gutenberg is going to represent some breaking changes around the around workflows and around the user experience the interface, especially like, we know that. But the opportunity to like have a thing that gives you an early taste of what&#8217;s coming but also the ability to keep kind of working in your old space where you need to, I think it&#8217;s an excellent way to bring people forward into the future of things, I have never been a fan of the just like cut off all avenues and hope that they stay with your method because of course, like you can&#8217;t cut off all the methods. You can&#8217;t cut off all the ways people can get away from you. And even if we could, it wouldn&#8217;t be in line with how WordPress hopes to kind of help people through some tough stuff like making your first website is hard. If you are doing it as part of, an overall campaign that&#8217;s supposed to bring in leads for you or generate revenue like you don&#8217;t want to necessarily play with that in a way that could break things and be risky for you in the long term. So I think all the tools that we offer to help people kind of move forward with the technology move forward with the CMS as it&#8217;s moving forward, I think it&#8217;s really smart. And so universal themes are one of those things, but also not around to stay. As we move into non modified themes, just the word themes that happen to be based in blocks. If I&#8217;ve confused anyone, please email me at wpbriefing@wordpress.org. And tell me how I confused you. And I will do a follow-up to unconfuse everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of the way that we help people kind of move forward with WordPress and with the technology. So much has been done in the CMS in the past 12 months in the past 18 months to be able to move themes into this same future as the rest of the editor. Right. So like, for folks who have not been listening to me for the last five years, you may not know this. So I&#8217;m going to tell everybody now, like one of the pain points that Gutenberg overall is solving is the fact that you for a long time had to learn five different editing interfaces to get one thing done in WordPress, right. And so like the advent of blocks and moving it into more and more spaces in the CMS is intended to really flatten the editing experience by making the type of user interaction the type of workflow really similar across all of the editing interfaces in the CMS. And so themes are a natural extension of that, where we can take similar user patterns and workflows, and work them out into themes. So over the last 12 months or so probably a little bit more, there&#8217;s been a lot of work on the CMS to move us forward in that that is now enabling the work that we want to be able to do to move things forward ahead. And so, I mean, this is probably our last question. Is there anything that you all want to offer to people who maybe saw themes early on or saw Gutenberg early on and felt like this is just not for me, in that in that context of like, how far it&#8217;s moved ahead in the past 12 months or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>19:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re asking like, what in the last 12 months has maybe like really surprised me or like sticks out to me as something that like, Wow, look how far we&#8217;ve come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So like, if you&#8217;re looking at what is the one thing that you saw in the last 12 months, that changed in the CMS that really enabled something wonderful for themes or from the other side of it. Like if someone had looked at themes or WordPress 18 months ago, and now they&#8217;re looking at it and seeing this new and different way to do things with the look and feel of their site, like what is one thing that they should be aware of? On either side of that question,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>20:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s more than one thing that has really evolved through this last year, year and a half. Like the maturity of some of the blocks is astounding now, like navigation blog, for example, was really bare-bones at the start and now it&#8217;s full potential, and it&#8217;s really looking really great. I would say the same thing about those days or the features on fire, like how basic it was at the start, was full potential. But now it&#8217;s really, really mature in terms of how much you can do with it. Like, I think the example, the perfect example of that is the work that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kjellr/\">Kjell [Reigstad]</a> has done on Twenty-Twenty Two with the alternative theme.json files, where just changing that file basically feels like a new theme, with just the configuration and the styles. And without writing any CSS without changing any templates. It&#8217;s really, really amazing how that can turn into a reality. And it&#8217;s so easy for users to tinker with that if they want to. And it&#8217;s much easier than having to delve deep into CSS and changing everything in like 2000 lines of code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>21:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I probably would echo most of that. What the thing that astounds me is global styles and how the UI can be shipping a theme or default theme with basically like, 20 lines of CSS, and have it be one of them. A beautiful, beautiful, like crisp and sharp, like, experience. It&#8217;s super fast. And it&#8217;s like, what this is a theme, you know, I thought a theme was supposed to supply all the styles like no, like, it&#8217;s just yeah. And workers do for you. Exactly. And like that. That&#8217;s pretty amazing to think in the last 12 months, we can go from, you know, shipping 1000s of lines of CSS to you none, it&#8217;s like, Wow, pretty cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my friends, thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a really interesting conversation. I hope that all y&#8217;all out listening. Also find it interesting. As I mentioned, if you have any follow-up questions, absolutely. Send them to me via email. And I collect all of my questions that I get through the year for answering at the end of the year, mostly because I don&#8217;t get lots of questions that people want to be answered on this. Everyone just asked me their questions on Twitter and in Slack, which is fine as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Maggie, Jeff, thank you both for joining me. And I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ll talk to you all again soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. In the last episode, I got all excited about being in the beta phase. But today, I&#8217;m rolling that back a little bit. As part of our usual open source processes, a group of contributors did a deep dive review on the WordPress 5.9 release and found a workflow that needed some refinement. So we are delaying the beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are in the midst of a major commerce slash/sales season, and of course, a lengthy holiday season, that delay also means that it makes sense to delay WordPress 5.9 final release a little as well. And so we are delaying that all the way into 2022 to January 25. For me, the trade-off works really well there. Every decision that we make in open source, of course, has some balance to it. It&#8217;s great for these aspects, it is less great for these aspects over here. But for myself, the opportunity to make sure that we have a really excellent experience for our users and also an opportunity to kind of avoid all of the chaos and hustle and bustle of the end of the year. Really, it seemed like a no-brainer for me. So in case you want to learn a little bit more about why we made the decision and get some insight into the actual milestones and where they have moved now, I&#8217;ll include some posts in the show notes below in case you want to read more and of course, if you have any additional questions you can always ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second small list of big things is that the first back to people WordCamp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re calling it. Our first back to people WordCamp is happening in a couple of weeks actually. WordCamp Sevilla is happening in person on December 11. And I&#8217;m so excited I wish I were local, but I&#8217;m not so if you are local stop by their website and pick up your ticket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our smallest a big things is that it is, of course, charitable giving season. I don&#8217;t know if you do your charitable giving at the end of the year or if that&#8217;s even part of your general ways of giving back. But I can think of two or three charitable organizations inside the WordPress ecosystem. There&#8217;s of course the WordPress Foundation, but also Big Orange Heart and HeroPress. If there are others out there, I certainly do want to know about them. WordPress Foundation also does additional giving on behalf of just like the open web and open source as a whole. So if you&#8217;re the sort of person who does their charitable giving at the end of the year, just a reminder that you have some options inside the WordPress ecosystem if you were trying to figure out some new places to donate to in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you so much for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. Thank you again to our special guests, Maggie and Jeff. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11636\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Watch State of the Word at a Watch Party with your WordPress Friends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/watch-state-of-the-word-at-a-watch-party-with-your-wordpress-friends/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:30:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11641\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:322:\"State of the Word 2021 is just around the corner!&#160; Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&#160; This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to [&#8230;]\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Hari Shanker R\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7280:\"\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">State of the Word 2021</a> is just around the corner!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although attending State of the Word in person would be ideal, not all WordPress community members get to enjoy the experience of attending the speech live with friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, as State of the Word is streamed live for the second time, we want to restore that in person camaraderie through State of the Word watch parties for WordPress Community members around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>We encourage WordPress meetup organizers and community members worldwide to (safely) host State of the Word 2021 watch parties —</strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/2021-state-of-the-word-watch-parties/\"><strong>read this handbook to learn more</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-organize-a-watch-party\">Why organize a watch party?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you are a <a href=\"https://meetup.com/pro/wordpress\">WordPress meetup</a> organizer, many folks in your meetup may be unaware of the State of the Word, and a watch party could be a great opportunity to introduce or remind them.</li><li>As meetup organizers slowly bid goodbye to a tough year, the watch party could be an excellent opportunity to revitalize your group, especially if you haven’t had many events this year.</li><li>Along with your Meetup group members, you get a platform to ask questions directly to Matt Mullenweg.</li><li>And last but not least, even if you are not a Meetup Organizer, a watch party can be the perfect opportunity to reconnect and have a blast with your WordPress friends!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-organize-a-state-of-the-word-watch-party\">How do I organize a State of the Word watch party?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to host a watch party online or in person.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was in a meeting recently, which I realize isn&#8217;t saying much for me since I spend a quarter of my time in meetings. But in this particular meeting, I was asked a couple of questions that I absolutely loved. The first question was, “if there were one thing you could change in people&#8217;s minds about WordPress, what would it be?” And my answer, predictable though it may be, was that I want to change the idea that WordPress is just a blogging platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has grown into a lot more than that. But the idea of a content management system, even now, sometimes gets a mental shorthand where content is a stand-in for the word writing or words. If you&#8217;re using WordPress today in an enterprise context, or as part of a governmental agency, or if you use it in a classroom setting, you know that your content cannot be confined that way. And if you&#8217;re supporting or building anything to hand off to clients, you know that timely, easy-to-ship changes on a site are considered a vital part of any overarching brand and marketing strategy. And when was the last time that any marketing strategy was literally only about the words?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was the first question. And also my first answer. There is also this kind of annual, not fear, necessarily, but this annual question that is sort of related that is raised to me and has been asked of me recently, that I&#8217;m just going to give you a small answer to. One annual worry that I get every year around November and December is, &#8220;What are we going to do about the fact that the term blog and blogging are declining in search popularity?&#8221; And I was gonna say it&#8217;s been a while since I answered that in any sort of public format. But I think maybe I&#8217;ve never answered it in a public format at all. And so I&#8217;m just going to answer it here. Because I think maybe a lot of people have that same question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So number one, I think that the way that people search now is different. There&#8217;s a lot more semantic cognition. This is not the way to answer this &#8212;  search engines are smarter now. So like, it used to be the case with early search engines that yeah, there was a lot of just like, individual search terms that were looked for. But now, people are asking full questions; they have, essentially, an entire sentence that they are searching for. And then, search engines are able to parse that information better and get more high-quality answers and information for them. So like, that&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m already not worried about. If people are searching for individual words anymore, it&#8217;s so that they can get a definition of that word. So I&#8217;m not specifically worried about a decline in search volume for the word blog or blogging for that reason. But the answer to my first question, if there is probably the real reason that I&#8217;m not actually super worried about any decline in search volume for the word blog, or blogging, is that WordPress has really moved beyond that. And since we have moved beyond that, then it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make sense for WordPress as an entity for WordPress as a project to get overly hung up on the idea that the term blog has gone out of fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now that I did my first question, and the answer, and then an additional question that only ever gets asked in private and is being answered by me for the first time in public, I will tell you now, the second question that I loved, someone asking of me, and that question is this: &#8220;What is one thing you&#8217;d like people to see or experience, right when they first land on wordpress.org?&#8221; Now, I often don&#8217;t get asked questions about the wordpress.org website, like administrative tasks, things that we need to update, move around where they should go. Sure. But like, “Josepha, what&#8217;s the point and purpose of this site?” Never. I&#8217;ve never been asked that, and so I was really excited that someone asked me, and I&#8217;m going to give you a heads up. I think some of you might disagree with my answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the primary thing that I want people to see or experience when they first get to wordpress.org, the website is the depth of WordPress. Not which audience segment they should belong to or that we believe they should belong to or raw data about the CMS or even how much we care about the freedoms of open source. Now the first thing I want people to see on that site is that WordPress has not only 18 years of learned knowledge that every single new user benefits from, but that it also has 1,000s of really smart people making sure it works and gets better every day, now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a Goliath in its field. I know that we cite this bit of context. Frequently, we say that we are 42% of the web. And that is true that is the percentage by usage. But in its field, which is websites that are using a content management system, we actually have a 65% market share. This is very easy to find. It&#8217;s on the W3Techs website: I can put a link in the show notes, but you could find it just by searching for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress is a Goliath in its field of websites that are run using a CMS. Because we have always brought our learnings forward with us with the understanding that knowledge, when shared grows rather than diminishes. But open source, the heart of what defines this project, open source is not a Goliath; it&#8217;s barely even David somedays. Even though the web is built on scads of open source software, there&#8217;s a pervasive public perception that it is built by and for hobbyists or that it is inherently risky, and that if there were if it were worth something, then people would pay something. And I just know that if the first impression of WordPress, we&#8217;re, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got 18 years of experience and learning that brought us to today,&#8221; the rest of the sale to adopt software that protects other people&#8217;s freedoms would take care of itself. And I guess, to quote John Oliver, at this point, &#8220;And now this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, that brings us now to our small list of big things. There are actually quite a few big things on this small list today. So number one, we have reached the beta phase for the year&#8217;s final release, which means that WordPress 5.9 beta one is happening tomorrow, Tuesday, November 16. And then seven days later, I believe on the 23rd, if I recall correctly, comes beta two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that team rep nominations are happening all over the project right now. I&#8217;ve got a post that I will share in the notes below that I believe all the team reps have put their team&#8217;s nomination posts on. So if you have had an interest in learning more about that and what it means to help keep teams kind of running in the WordPress project, then this is a great opportunity to check those out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing, this last thing actually isn&#8217;t in the next two weeks, but it is very important, nonetheless. Matt&#8217;s annual State of the Word is coming up on December 14. So basically a month from today. It&#8217;s going to join the growing list of in-person events that are on the calendar. It will be in New York City but will also be live-streamed across the world as usual. Keep an eye out for additional updates about that for anyone who, like me, really looks forward to this particular presentation from our project co-founder every year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11556\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"State of the Word 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 00:38:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11567\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:346:\"Howdy, World!&#160; Mark your calendars; it’s almost time for State of the Word 2021!

In the inaugural year of the survey (2015), over 50,000 responses were collected. Given the reach and adoption of WordPress, there is a significant number we have not reached.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The month of November includes the Thanksgiving holiday in my part of the world and in my familial traditions. And one of the things that November always brings up for me is the concept of gratitude. I have a gratitude practice that lasts throughout the year. But this time of year always kind of lets me look outside what makes me feel routinely grateful and explore areas that I don&#8217;t always notice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I&#8217;m taking some time to do that in the context of the WordPress project, and it&#8217;s reminded me of one of the foundational things I talk about a lot that may be a little harder for folks to see. I am routinely grateful, of course, for the people who show up to maintain WordPress, the people who keep the back office work going, the contributors who contribute directly to the WordPress CMS and project, the folks who routinely go out and tell other people about WordPress and make sure others know how to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s another group that I talk about a lot that is a little harder to grasp. And that&#8217;s this conceptual group of people whose lives have been changed by WordPress. I used to run into people like this all the time when I was organizing WordCamps. And the small but meaningful successes that they share year after year made me realize that my small contribution of organizing these events was really quite valuable; valuable to them, and I assumed also valuable to just other people in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re contributing in a way that doesn&#8217;t let you have contact with the same users consistently over time, or if contributing doesn&#8217;t quite balance out in your ledger at the moment, it can be hard to put names to faces in a way that lets you see how your contributions are making an impact. To help with that, a few years ago, the WordPress project partnered with the community Marketing team and the HeroPress team to share the People of WordPress series which you can find monthly on wordpress.org/news. For me, this series provides a glimpse into the humanity of the people who use WordPress, and for me, that&#8217;s enough. If all the series ever did was to remind us that WordPress was made for people whose needs matter, that would be enough to continue to have that series forever. But fortunately, the series does quite a bit more than that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People of WordPress series also lifts up the stories of people who we don&#8217;t always hear from in technology. It highlights the wide array of origin stories that lead people to WordPress. It reminds us of the global nature of what we&#8217;re doing. It reconnects us to the hopefulness of our own first WordPress successes. And it draws a direct line to why we should care about refreshing the commons of this open ecosystem. I&#8217;m sure that there are more things that do as well. But those are just the things off the top of my head, we draw all of the people of WordPress stories that are inside that series directly from the HeroPress essays that have been submitted by users. And I was gonna say users like you in a kind of Reading Rainbow way. But I actually don&#8217;t know if any of you are everyday users who are also using WordPress but maybe not contributing yet. If you are then like I&#8217;m talking to you. And if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m probably still talking to you. Because all of these stories that go to HeroPress are very valuable and very important for us to know. Anyway, I digress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>, who founded HeroPress, is among the first people I met in the community lo these many years ago. And I think the impact that HeroPress has on the WordPress community as a whole is not always well recognized. So in the spirit of expanding the scope of my gratitude, and in the context of refreshing the commons, I would encourage you to head over to HeroPress.com and their newly launched HeroPress Network and see if there&#8217;s any little way that you can contribute to their commons, submitting your story donating to their network offering a small bit of volunteer time if you happen to have any spare time lying around. I know that the team would be delighted to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us now to our small list of big things. We are about a week away from the feature freeze for WordPress 5.9, the final release of the year. Feature freeze caused a little confusion last time. So I just want to clarify there won&#8217;t be a package released with this milestone. But no more enhancements or features will be worked on at that point. And bug fixing will become the primary focus. That will be on November 9, which I believe is next Tuesday. It&#8217;s definitely next week whenever the calendar turns to nine of November 2021. That&#8217;s the day that we&#8217;re going into feature freeze.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big thing in our small list of big things is that team rep nomination season is upon us. If you are a team rep or want to learn more about being one, now is the time to kind of look at what&#8217;s going on and how to keep everything moving in that way. I&#8217;ll include a link to the announcement post of that in the notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, Daylight Saving Time movements are also upon us. Some parts of the world are ending Daylight Saving Time others are starting it and some have already started or stopped that already.

This month we feature a WordPress e-commerce specialist on the difference it makes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Empowered to make a change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For WordPress contributor Ronald Gijsel, open source is a lifeline and a perfect place for people with creative minds. It led him on a transformational journey from chef to WordPress e-commerce specialist. Originally from the Netherlands, where he trained in hospitality, he was to find a restorative and energizing power within the WordPress local and global community. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, life took a sad turn for Ronald and his wife Nihan when their baby daughter passed away only a few days after she was born. At that time, Ronald was a restaurant owner in the UK, working hard in a challenging economic environment.&nbsp;Discovering open source was in many ways his lifeline and helped him and his wife through their considerable heartache. Through this community, a journey to understand the opportunities of the web and new career paths began.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/ronaldgijsel2-1.jpg?w=632&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait picture of Ronald Gijsel\" class=\"wp-image-11403\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes that working together in WordPress and other open source communities can lead to massive benefits for a large number of users. Not least, an online presence has been essential to the survival of many businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During recent years, he has visited open source events worldwide as a partnership manager at a WordPress e-commerce plugin company and community supporter. His enthusiasm for WordPress has steered him to being part of local support, solutions and collaboration as a co-organizer of <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a> Bristol, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cheltenham-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress Cheltenham Meetup</a> and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moving forward&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Nihan enrolled in the UK&#8217;s Open University to complete her computer science degree, Ronald found her course materials stirring his own interest. He started to follow the lectures with her and even attempted some of the course work for himself &#8211; all whilst he continued to work as a chef in various local pubs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this, he discovered how to generate affiliate commission earnings through blogging on different platforms. “Creating websites was slowly becoming a passion. In these first few years, I enjoyed every part of the steep learning curve, from tackling the basics to more advanced coding and designs,” said Ronald.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Start of a Web Career</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald reduced his hours as a chef and devoted more time to online courses learning coding, e-commerce, SEO, and online marketing. Yet when he applied for a job as a WordPress designer, he had only heard of the platform in the context of blogging. This was all to change when an online tutor on one of the training sites revealed the many functions available with WordPress. It was the start of a new career and life journey. This tutor was Topher DeRosia, who went on to create <a href=\"https://heropress.com/\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=632%2C467&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald Gijsel and Topher De Rosia at \na WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-11398\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=300%2C222&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/with-topher.jpg?resize=768%2C567&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Ronald with Topher at WordCamp London in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn WordPress, Ronald ‘binge-watched’ webinars on various development topics and over time he became more familiar with it. Securing a job as a designer was only the beginning of his journey into the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later in 2015, after landing the job as a WordPress designer, Ronald&#8217;s boss asked him to consider taking on the business and its clients. With his wife, Ronald decided to take on the firm and to expand their work in WordPress e-commerce and online marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an advocate for learning new skills and practicing them, Ronald encourages others to continue to expand their knowledge through study, attending talks at Meetups and WordCamps, and using the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WordPress has evolved in so many branches that require different skills. There are hundreds of areas of expertise, roles, and jobs that complement WordPress to make it what it is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"528\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?resize=528%2C652&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald talking about WordPress and e-commerce solutions\" class=\"wp-image-11414 size-full\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?w=528&amp;ssl=1 528w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup3-1.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">“WordPress is an essential tool in my box.”<br><em><strong>Ronald Gijsel</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald believes WordPress thrives on diversity, with many <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">contributor opportunities</a> and jobs in the ecosystem that require a wide range of skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A big part of this is that each person’s personal background complements their skill sets. Who you are and what you do is influenced by what you have done and learned. We need to cherish this. These things also add to our culture, language, experience, and knowledge,” he said.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A journey into WordPress e-commerce</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?resize=632%2C442&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Ronald presenting on WordPress and e-commerce at an event\" class=\"wp-image-11400\" width=\"632\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=900%2C630&amp;ssl=1 1800w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/meetup2.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=900%2C630&amp;ssl=1 2700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Ronald shares his enthusiasm for building WordPress and e-commerce websites at WordCamp London in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald initially extended his interest in the&nbsp;WordPress ecosystem through representing a plugin company at WordCamps in the UK. He became hooked and went on to attend events in many different countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, he realized he could do more with his connections and create meaningful partnerships. Within a few weeks, he had crafted his dream job and sent a proposal to the CEO of a WordPress e-commerce firm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But pitching to strangers wasn’t an easy task, as he did not know if they would understand his vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “The doubts went through my head for months. ‘Do I give up my business and work for the benefit of another company? What if I don’t get on? What do I do with my customers?’ But I decided to take the leap.&#8221; His pitch proved successful, joining his current firm in 2019.<br><br>In the firm’s CEO, Ronald found a mentor, supporter, and a friend. He explained: “Nando Pappalardo never tells me what to do, but instead, he asks questions to make me realize what is achievable, or could be even better. He simply makes suggestions that I read something and reach my own conclusions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking back at the journey&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking risks or changing directions in mid-career often involves a giant leap. In Ronald&#8217;s view, through WordPress, you don&#8217;t need to be alone. He believes its community can offer support and help to process thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald said: “I often think back to the moment my daughter passed away. She only lived for a few days. Every day, I wonder how events would have unfolded if she had survived. Maybe her memory lives on in every decision I make and the paths I decide to take.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From his experience, he found that&nbsp;changing a career can sometimes take a few years and have a period of transition. He said: “Only looking back do I realize that each small step slowly made a difference in my life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“It was WordPress that made the online world easier to navigate and empowered me to make a change”&nbsp;</p><cite>Ronald Gijsel</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “Feeling welcomed into the WordPress community through Meetups and WordCamps added a human dimension and confidence that I can do ‘this’ too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronald’s wish is that his story will offer support to others who may have experienced tragedy in their lives. “I hope that I can give you the hope and strength to try and put your energy into something else that can lead to more significant changes in your life. Try to take it as one positive decision at a time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help us share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series.</a>&nbsp;#ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@</a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">webcommsat</a>), and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>) for the interviews and writing this feature, and to Ronald Gijsel (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/just2ronald/\">@just2ronald</a>) for sharing his story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Anjana Vasan (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anjanavasan/\">@anjanavasan</a>), Collieth Clarke (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/callye/\">@callye</a>), and Reyes Martinez (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rmartinezduque/\">@rmartinezduque</a>) for their content contributions, and Josepha Haden Chomphosy (@<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">chanthaboune</a>), and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) for their support for the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today marks the start of Digital Citizenship week. This year in 2021, it is the week of October 18th, and to kick it off, I want to share with you a bit of a lecture that I gave to a college class last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An economics professor teaches this class. And so, a little bit, I went to talk about how WordPress is essentially a microcosm of global societies. That was mostly why I was invited to come and give the talk. But one of the students asked a really interesting question about economics, and especially the economics of WordPress. And so, I&#8217;m going to take some time to do my best to answer that question here as well. But first, we&#8217;re going to start with some big picture information about WordPress that I shared with the students, and then maybe you also don&#8217;t necessarily know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first place that we started was with the question of what WordPress is. Most of them had heard of it but didn&#8217;t necessarily have a good handle on what it is. And so this is the definition that I gave to them. This is a bit of each of the facets of WordPress that we kind of see right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, WordPress is, of course, a content management system, which means it&#8217;s a piece of software that uses a copyleft license, which means that it&#8217;s open source, and no one individual necessarily owns the rights to the code. If you get very specific, WordPress is, of course, a FOSS project or a free and open source software project. I know that there are discussions around when a piece of software is free, then what are you using to pay for that piece of software or to pay for your access to that software? And often, the answer is that you&#8217;re using your personally identifying information to pay for something commonly referred to as the data economy. If you&#8217;re not familiar with that, it&#8217;s a little bit of a three-pronged effort there. So you submit your data to get access to the software, or you can join the platform, depending on what it is that you&#8217;re working with. That platform or that software collects your data so that they can build a profile about what sorts of content engages you and so that they can share, essentially, audience cohorts like groups of people that kind of are talking about what you&#8217;re talking about, agree with what you agree about, and find interesting, the same sorts of things that you find interesting. And then those companies sell access to your attention. This is something that I refer to as the attention economy. I think there are a lot of startups at the moment that refers to the attention economy. The most iconic recent example was when the folks over at Netflix said that they weren&#8217;t competing against other streaming services; they were competing against sleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that might ring true for quite a few of us at the moment. But anyway, to scoot us back one level, I had, as I said, WordPress is free software. But the difference with WordPress is that to get a copy of WordPress, you are not necessarily required to hand over any data. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone data to get a copy. You don&#8217;t need to give anyone money or data to open up a copy that you own or to build a website in it if you&#8217;re just doing it locally, but especially around that data side because WordPress is not collecting any data, we&#8217;re also not brokering access to anyone&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another answer to the question of &#8220;What is WordPress?&#8221; WordPress software and the project enable nearly half a trillion dollars of revenue in the global digital economy, as we learned from a recent study from one of the hosting companies inside the WordPress project&nbsp; &#8211; oh, Inside the WordPress ecosystem anyway. And WordPress also runs 42% of the web, with some of the biggest sites we know using WordPress. Such sites like the New York Times, Rolling Stone, many, many others, which you can see in the WordPress showcase as well. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to just like call out all the big groups that use it. But it&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;To recap what we just learned about WordPress and what WordPress is. It is software that one uses a copyleft license, meaning no single entity owns it. Two, it is available at no cost, meaning no money changes hands for you to own a copy. Three does not track you, which means that you don&#8217;t have to give WordPress any personally identifying information to get a copy. Four is an enabler of a massive digital economy massive portion of the digital economy even. That, you know, means their services, extensions, themes, plugins, all of that stuff. And five, it is software that supports 42% of the web. Practically every other site you visit uses the software. So that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this massive free software, you might be thinking to yourself a couple of things. The first thing you might be thinking is, &#8220;Well, that sounds impossible.&#8221; But if that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re thinking, you may be thinking, &#8220;how is it possible that a software that is technically owned by no one and takes no money or data to obtain &#8211;&nbsp; how is it that a software like that can power 42% of the web.&#8221; This brings me, of course, to a topic that I specialize in, which is how WordPress is made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is, by now you know, built by a global community of contributors. And it&#8217;s partially contributors that are self-sponsored or giving of their own time freely, and partly sponsored volunteers, people who are paid by Five for the Future initiatives inside various companies. I have said many times, most recently at WordCamp US, that I have an ideal ratio of about two to one in that kind of volunteer or self-sponsored versus corporately sponsored set of voices. And also, as I said, at WordCamp US, we’re not necessarily getting to that ideal ratio right now because of the nature of the way the world is at the moment. However, this community functions almost like a tiny little digital society. There are ways to get your voice heard ways to take on leadership roles; there is a little bit of light governmental structure. And as with any society, any community like this, there&#8217;s a relationship inherent there. There&#8217;s almost a transactional element that takes place when you&#8217;re participating fully. Although I know that for the WordPress project, especially for open source in general, there is a reminder that we should always be contributing without the expectation of reciprocity. But even if you are contributing without the expectation of reciprocity, you still are engaging in an existing community, which means that you are fostering a relationship with the community or with the people who are also participating in the community with you. It&#8217;s just inescapable if you have people around and working together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So two concepts really informed my work to future-proof the WordPress project. And the first one is digital citizenship, which is why this particular WordPress Briefing fits today. And the other is the Tragedy of the Commons, especially how we go about refreshing those commons. So digital citizenship, I talked about it a bit in the last WP Briefing. But it&#8217;s still true today that that&#8217;s important. And the thing that really matters to me as we are working through how to make sure that WordPress is moving forward together. But most discussions of citizenship are location-specific, which makes plenty of sense. However, with so many mobile devices and broader access to some level of internet, we have increasing opportunities to be connected because of interests or skill sets. And even the things that we aspire to or aspire to be with a community like WordPress, which has no home office or main location. Of course, it&#8217;s very important that all of the leaders in WordPress, all of the team reps in WordPress, are proactively engaging with the people in their teams and in their portions of the community instead of waiting for like happenstance running into people. We also use a bunch of social stuff to get people together: twitch screams, not twitch screams because it&#8217;s not that Halloweeny! Twitch streams, hallway hangouts, events that are both online and off. Everything that the Learn section of the community is doing with their discussion groups. There are so many ways that WordPress proactively engages with each other and engages with itself. And that work is all really important to keeping the community involved, which is key to any organization&#8217;s long-term success, and certainly is true for WordPress as long-term success. Because when your community or your organization or your society is engaged and invested in your collective success, then you are (get ready for a list) one, more likely to see obstacles early and be able to overcome them, two more likely to see upcoming trends and prepare for them, three more likely to see what is broken and be able to repair it before it is a major issue. And four, you are more likely to be a resilient and fruitful organization long after any single member has stopped participating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more connected to the community you are and the more active, the greater your influence and the ability to affect changes also become. And so, not only is it important for us to remain connected as a community just to make sure that everything is going well. But also, it&#8217;s one of the primary ways that people who are giving back can sort of have more of an opportunity in this particular ecosystem. In open source, anyone can gain influence by helping others by helping the software and by keeping the trains on the tracks. And so, one of the only lasting limits to long-term potential in an open source project is how good you are at seeing beyond yourself and seeing what good action can make beyond just your own benefits. I understand that there are also specific hurdles to contribution in your free time that I have dedicated a couple of different podcasts to, so I don&#8217;t want to neglect that reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have found in my experience that one of the limiting factors that sometimes cannot be unlearned is not being able to see kind of a broader scope, a broader perspective than what you&#8217;re already bringing into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being a good digital citizen, that&#8217;s a really important part of keeping any society together any organization together and moving forward. But especially is in the context of digital citizenship, is true for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that is really important to me is this concept of the Tragedy of the Commons, which is, of course, an economics term, open source has borrowed. We have talked about it in this podcast in the past. And today, I specifically am talking about how WordPress works to consistently be refreshing the commons. So the theory of the Tragedy of the Commons says that all societies can withstand a certain volume of free-riders. A certain number of people who reap the benefits of that community’s society without necessarily putting anything back into it. And that is no different in open source than in any other place where you would apply this concept. The particular catch for WordPress is of course, that it is free, freely available and has no specific copyright holder. And so in those circumstances, it is incredibly easy for a small group of people to maintain the software while the whole world uses it for free. And not only is it possible for a small group of people to maintain it, but if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s also easy for a small group of unpaid people and unacknowledged people to maintain something forever. And at the volume that WordPress operates at, that&#8217;s a really risky choice. It doesn&#8217;t help to support those people; it puts the long-term stability of the software in jeopardy. And at the end of the day, it just does not help to replenish the commons to make sure that everybody keeps getting to have the benefits of this ecosystem in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many of you know, there is this program called Five for the Future. And that program is essentially modeled after a tithe. So the invitation to this program when it was first introduced in 2014 was that if you or your company or your community is made better or made possible by WordPress, you should give back to the WordPress project 5% of your resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an aspirational 5%, of course, and some groups give back their time while others give back with their money. But almost anyone who wants to give back has some skill that WordPress needs. That particular program has really grown in leaps and bounds since it was introduced. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many team members were considered Five for the Future contributors when it was first introduced in 2014; it was a little before my time. But at the moment, it&#8217;s about 150 people that I am routinely aware of or in contact with, which is still a small number considering how many people use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many corporations who have seen the most benefit, including, you know, the company that I work for (Automattic), and a lot of other hosting companies in the ecosystem, all do a really good job of refreshing the commons so that WordPress is still usable for businesses of all levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to leave us with one final big picture thought about open source. This is going to be a callback to one of my earliest episodes in this podcast. But I think that it&#8217;s always worth remembering. We&#8217;re going to talk about this really popular phrase in open source projects &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; And for WordPress, as you know, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It&#8217;s literally free. But also, since it&#8217;s open source, it has a free as in speech component to it as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four freedoms of open source as laid out in the 90s. So 10 years into the open source movement, are basically that you have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study how the program works, and change it so that it can do your computing as you wish, the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help your neighbor and the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to learn and benefit from the changes that you put into the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember if I said this in my original podcast, but I&#8217;m going to say it today, free speech has a lot of responsibility, just like being a part of a community. Governments or communities, or in our case, this software is built by the people who show up. For WordPress at 42% of the web, every small choice we make can cause huge changes in how people experience the web today and tomorrow. And that, to my mind, is really no different than participating in any sort of civic infrastructure. The changes that are made today, or the errors that we prevent, set the tone and the circumstance and the potential to thrive for everyone who comes after us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>18:17</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads us into our smallest of big things. I just have a couple of things for you all today. Firstly, at the time of this recording, this is prior to the Go/No-Go demo meeting for WordPress 5.9. So I have no idea what&#8217;s happened. But by the time this podcast has been released, we will have had the Go/No-Go meeting and also have shipped the post that summarizes what happened, what we hope to change in the next essentially sprint so that we can confidently move forward with a clear set of features for the 5.9 release. I will include a link to the notes below in the show notes. Kudos to everyone, props to everyone who participated in that meeting. And also props to all the people who have been helping us as we head into this final release of the year and all of you who are going to help us make it successfully to the end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing I already kind of alluded to at the top of the podcast, it is Digital Citizenship week; two or three years ago, the WordPress blog had a series about digital citizenship and what it means to be a good digital citizen, what it means to do that in the context of WordPress. I will drop a link to those posts in the show notes as well. They are very well written and very important, and fairly evergreen content. If I think that there is something worth updating, I will update it before putting it in the show notes. And that is your small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all for tuning in today for the WordPress sprint. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11351\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"The Month in WordPress: September 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 20:01:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11327\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:351:\"There’s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping slightly imperfect work.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I want to talk to you a little bit about the digital divide, where it is, maybe a bit of where it&#8217;s headed, and which parts of the WordPress open source project and CMS can help. This is a focused look, though, so I won&#8217;t touch on some of the hurdles that everyone is aware of when you get outside of in-person environments, things like parental modeling or supervision, education on the relevance of technology, etc. This is a follow-up to the conversation that I had at WordCamp US last week—and so doing a little bit of a deeper dive here. And we&#8217;re gonna start with what exactly is the digital divide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the digital divide is considered those who benefit from the digital age versus those who don&#8217;t; that feels like a really big concept. And the current discussion is primarily about access, or for years that has been about access anyway, especially physical access. So those who have computers versus those who do not have internet in their homes versus those who do not. But I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with that particular, really focused definition of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only problem we see is access, then the solution becomes to get cheap devices and internet to everyone, which certainly has led to more people being connected than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this proliferation of devices that are considered both smart and mobile (mobile in this context, meaning handheld or pocket-sized), the discussion over the last few years has been shifting. It’s been shifting into more of a discussion around the education around the relevance of internet access, discussions around the quality of access to the Internet, and also discussions around Wi-Fi and dial-up and the surprising cost of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from my perspective, there are a number of really dangerous assumptions that we make when we boil it all the way down to who has access and the quality of that kind of access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first dangerous assumption is that we run the risk of conflating being tech-savvy with being digitally literate, and they&#8217;re not really the same things. The second assumption that we run the risk of is assuming that access to cellular data equals access to the internet through any other means. And also assuming that cost is always the determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final fairly dangerous assumption that we&#8217;re making there is that we allow ourselves the ability to mark the digital divide is fixed in our minds. Once we get enough access to everyone, we&#8217;re just done. There is no more divide. But as a way of illustration, if you think about access, not in the context of technology, like high technology, digital technology, and in the context of like writing, you probably own a writing utensil, and you probably have access to paper of some sort, which is great. But just because you have like a pencil and a piece of paper doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you home right now &#8211; I guess most of you are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you to your desk right now. And consider you prepared to write a best-selling novel, right? Because giving you physical tools no more makes you a novelist than handing me a computer when I was a teen made me digitally literate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what it takes to be digitally literate. I&#8217;ve lumped the following skills into three groups. It&#8217;s broadly defined as 21st-century skills, but the groups that I have them in is not a comprehensive list of those 21st-century skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group that is a large component of digital literacy is critical thinking skills. So computational thinking and problem-solving. That particular one is not new, exactly. But the computational thinking part certainly is. Not all problems are solved with code, but the basis for thinking through things procedurally is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one in that set is communication through multiple media, consuming communications or content through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other format, but also creating the things that communicate—writing blogs, creating videos, both calls and standalone, and forums, things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set in that group of critical thinking skills is around collaboration, which some people will say is more about communication. But I find that collaboration both online and in-person is a skill set all to its own. Communication only gets you so far when you&#8217;re learning to cook to collaborate with people that you don&#8217;t normally work with. And so, I have lumped that into critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big bucket for digital literacy is actually literally digital literacy. So I have three, three things in here as well. Evaluating information is obviously incredibly important in the environment that we&#8217;re in right now, for just information’s sake. But then things like understanding the differences between copyright versus copyleft licenses, understanding the difference between an .org ending URL and a .com ending URL, and evaluating the general veracity of sources that you&#8217;re finding on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that group is media use and creation, understanding the difference between folks who consume and folks who create the content we have, how to find information online, and the most sensible places to keep information online. And the third area of digital literacy that I find to be vitally important is the ethics of licenses both around use and access. So again, things like copyright vs. Copy, copyleft. And specifically for WordPress, that means understanding things like the Creative Commons licenses, GPL, MIT, but then also copyright is its own complicated question unto itself. But the other things that show up for us for WordPress that show up for us with technology are also things like open access versus proprietary information and sources. And things like plagiarism versus sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our third big bucket, which has become increasingly complex, but the third big bucket for digital literacy to my mind is actually considered something that I call life skills. So things like self-direction, knowing what you want to do next, and how to get it done. Time management is also in there, knowing how much time something will take and being able to make sure that you are getting things done over time, as opposed to trying to accomplish everything at the last second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of these life skills is cross-cultural and social communication. The internet is tricky, right? Because it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly insular and increasingly global. Like you can if you wanted only ever read things that already confirm your existing biases. But the very nature of the internet, the very nature of the web, means that the world is much smaller. We have more ready access faster to everyone everywhere in the world than we used to have. This means, of course, that cultural awareness is an absolute must now more than ever. This is for what it&#8217;s worth the time of year when I give this talk. And that&#8217;s because of this last part of the life skills section, which is digital citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship generally is the second week of October 2 or the third week of October. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite weeks because it is something that comes up all the time in our ecosystem. It comes up all the time and open source in general, but certainly for WordPress. So those are our three big buckets of digital literacy, a subset of 21st-century skills as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, I know. And it&#8217;s also really hard to figure out how you can learn any of those skills, and from my experience, I really believe that WordPress as an open source project can help people learn those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, my mother told me that in order for me to become a better writer, I would have to read and in order to become a better communicator, it would probably help if I spent a little bit more time writing, and I have always felt that the same must be true for all the things that we learn, you find a positive example and study it to become better. Or, depending on what you&#8217;re learning and how you&#8217;re trying to learn it, you find a passive example of something that you want to be able to do better from an active standpoint and participate in that so that your active production of the other part is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few parts of the WordPress project and WordPress itself that can help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are first a few really specific teams; if you&#8217;re contributing to a team like Themes, or Plugins, or Core, the three areas of those digital literacy skills that you have an opportunity to learn there. For critical thinking, you&#8217;re going to run into problem-solving and computational thinking. You’re also going to run into distributed collaboration, which was really important as just a concept when I first wrote this talk. And now it is currently really important as a reality because we have a bunch of companies that are going to either remote work or partially distributed or fully distributed. And that&#8217;s the way that WordPress has worked for a pretty long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve always felt like it was important because it was important to WordPress, but it&#8217;s also becoming increasingly an important part of just how to exist in the world at the moment. For those three teams, the things that you can really tap into and practice for the life skill section are digital literacy, nope, digital citizenship, self-direction, and time management obviously comes up in any open source project because you are volunteering your time and it is up to you to kind of decide how much you can commit or not various other parts of time management and directing one&#8217;s own project. Now, but you also get the opportunity to test and practice your cross-cultural communication, social communication and learning what it means to collaborate across cultures in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the digital literacy side, you also get a little bit of that information evaluation and synthesis for what it&#8217;s worth. And then obviously get to learn more about the ethics of various types of licenses and how use and access relate to those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a team or two; these are not really teams or twos. These are things that you can do that are either solo activities or group activities. One is working or checking out the support forums, and the other is blogging. We’ll start with support forums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing this as a group activity, there are a couple of extra things that that you can practice here. But suppose you&#8217;re doing it as a solo, just way to give back to the project sort of thing or way to learn some of these skills sort of thing. In that case, you can get almost all of these digital literacy skills woven into working in the support forums, depending on what&#8217;s happening in the moment and the questions people have brought up. But for critical thinking, obviously, you get some problem solving in there, not as much the computational thinking as the procedural thinking part. But you certainly also get to tap into communication with multiple types of media, collaboration in person and online, depending on whether you&#8217;re doing this as a solo effort or a group effort. And then, of course, research, which I didn&#8217;t really bring up in any of those groupings for digital literacy, is certainly a very important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the digital literacy grouping of skills related to digital literacy, you get to work on evaluating information and, depending on how complicated an answer might be. You can also get that opportunity to practice synthesizing complex information and research, a digital literacy skill. And then, once people have responded to a topic you&#8217;ve answered, you also get to tap into that life skill section. You get to be you get the opportunity to practice digital citizenship related to synchronous or asynchronous conversation. You also get to see more about how cross-cultural communication and collaboration works and social communication across those various boundaries that naturally show up when we&#8217;re working across cultures that way. And as I mentioned previously, information synthesis, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one that I have mentioned can be like a solo effort or a group effort, depending on what you do. Blogging, for most people who use WordPress, is probably the most common application of how WordPress can help you do stuff. So I often see it as the most relevant and the most immediately accessible to anyone. But you know, you got to meet people where they are. So, I would strongly believe that this is our best way to help people learn these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blogging for the critical thinking sorts of things, you have an opportunity to practice communication across mediums. You will probably get an opportunity to practice your research skills, chances are, you&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to practice some problem solving, and honestly, like if you&#8217;re hosting your site, problem-solving is going to come up when using WordPress as soon as you add in plugins and themes, because you sometimes kind of have to figure out what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and what&#8217;s playing nicely with other things and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s possible that with blogging, you&#8217;re also going to have an opportunity to get to practice some distributed collaboration. But that&#8217;s probably going to depend on what you&#8217;re doing with your site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licenses and how they apply to the thing that you&#8217;re using feel a bit different when you are the one who&#8217;s creating. And so learning about how those things work and don&#8217;t work and how they can best suit what you&#8217;re trying to do. Blogging is absolutely an excellent opportunity to dig into that a bit and learn a bit more about that. As far as your life skills go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s where you, again, get to practice some digital citizenship by figuring out who your audiences are and also when you have to communicate with them via the comments or any other way that you have built up a feedback mechanism there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-direction obviously will come into this, maybe time management if you are blogging on, I was gonna say on a paid basis, but that&#8217;s not really I don&#8217;t know, on a project basis, like some of us are students and have to write things based on deadlines. And so, you know, self-direction, potentially time management, always cross-cultural communication, social communication, research, all of these things show up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I really believe in this concept of how blogging and bringing people into maintaining a website can teach you all of these skills. Because when I was younger, I was a bad communicator. And now, I am across the board known for my effective communication and my ability to work across cultures. And so the defining moment, which was like a four-year moment, and so not necessarily a moment, but the thing that really made all the difference was when my mom challenged me to write every single day. She had noted that I was not necessarily great at getting from one point to the next. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily great at building my arguments when I had to explain something to people. And she suggested that writing every day would help me tap into this big thing about communication and working with other people collaboration, all of that. And as an adult on the other side of it. Like, I thought she was super wrong when I was younger, because don&#8217;t we all think our parents are wrong when we&#8217;re younger. But as an adult on the other side of it, not only was that an opportunity for me to literally learn how to communicate better. But it also, when I look at it, gave me access to opportunities to practice all sorts of 21st-century skills and digital literacy skills in an environment that was relatively safe. And so, I am a big proponent of this particular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that helps us tap into and practice a lot of our digital literacy skills is the Documentation team. I recommend that you let this be a supervised activity if you&#8217;re doing this with students because, you know, it&#8217;s a wiki. You can put weird things in there on accident or just inaccurate things. So for critical thinking, the primary skill that you&#8217;re going to be able to practice if you&#8217;re working on documentation is collaboration. You would think that it was also like information synthesis and information evaluation. But for a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing, the documentation exists. And what we&#8217;re looking at is trying to figure out where it no longer matches what is currently in the CMS, or currently in the project or currently in the team, whatever it is that you&#8217;re working on at that moment. And so, it&#8217;s a strong collaborative effort in the WordPress project. You have to have done the general work to figure out what needs to be changed in the documentation. But a lot of times, you need to figure out who has access to make the changes, what has prevented us from making changes in the past, and things like that. And so I say, collaboration is the only one to learn and critical thinking, but it&#8217;s actually a really big one and can take a fair amount of effort in this particular context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>20:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the digital literacy aspect, of course, there is evaluating information. But this particular type of information evaluation is a little different for documentation. And this actually is true for the Documentation team, for the Training team, and also for the new Learn team. This question is true for all of them. There is a huge difference between presentation versus application of information. The way you present information for people who already know it and just need confirmation of something or are using it for reference material is really different from when people are looking at a piece of documentation that should be telling them how to accomplish something. And they try to apply it either to their own processes at the moment or apply it to teaching other people. And so evaluating information to make sure that what is presented can be applied, and all of the ways that that very complicated journey with managing information can kind of work or not, depending on how things are going in your section of the open source project at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>21:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third group of skills that you can really dig into in those teams, again, is digital citizenship, basically, everything is digital citizenship in WordPress because we&#8217;re just people online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this final grouping that we have this final team and group of skills. So the Community team is a substantial and far-ranging team; they have many things that fall into their area of expertise. And so this has traditionally kind of functioned as a linchpin around education and ensuring that that was all relevant for users and attendees of events. The Community team will remain pivotal to so many things that we do now. But now that we have really awakened the Learn team and re-enlivened that Training team, this will shift a little over time. But yes, so that grain of salt that depending on when you listen to this, if you listen to it in 2050, maybe it&#8217;s not accurate anymore. Hopefully, most of what I say is not accurate in 2050. But you know, still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anyway! Critical thinking that&#8217;s where we were. So the critical thinking group of skills inside the Community team, you are going to have an opportunity to practice problem-solving. And frequently also procedural thinking, depending on what you&#8217;re working on in that team. Multimedia communication is absolutely true. And that&#8217;s true, whether you contribute to the team itself and make sure that the team is functioning and doing their basic tasks. Or if you are organizing an entire event, whether it&#8217;s online or offline or however that is being accomplished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia communication for this particular team is constant for all of their work and something that everyone who works on there gets to practice all the time. For digital literacy, this comes up a lot if what you&#8217;re doing is working through any sort of like programming plans, making sure that what we have in place for events is really excellent. It&#8217;s a really excellent opportunity for practicing the evaluation of information, learning more about media use and creation, and then naturally, everything to do with licenses copyright copyleft, not only for everything that we produce but then also for everyone in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team helps so many plugins, authors and theme developers, and other groups who participate in the ecosystem understand the nuances of the GPL and why it matters so much to WordPress. And then in the life skill section, there&#8217;s the obvious life skill section, life skills that have come up for all of them—so digital citizenship, cross-cultural and social communication. But also you have the opportunity to tap into that self-direction and time management practice, which probably should also be considered in all of these teams. But, you know, things change as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the most likely digital literacy skills that you would end up practicing in the Community team, depending on how you are participating in the Community team at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said that we would talk a little bit about where this is all headed and what to do next. And like I just said, when I got lost in my own reverie, they&#8217;re like, hopefully, everything that I&#8217;ve shared here is out of date by 2050. Like, if we can come back to this particular podcast, or this presentation, or anything I&#8217;ve ever said, about digital literacy over my time with WordPress. And if we could come back to that in 2050, or, you know, I was going to say, 20 years from now, 2041 feels really close. But, you know, come back to it in the future, and say, that was all really excellent information to know at the moment. And we did do those things. And now, WordPress has proven that open source contribution and collaboration can teach all of the necessary 21st-century skills that anyone would need to survive in the world. And we did do it, that would be really cool. But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Not because I don&#8217;t think people believe in what I&#8217;m saying or care about what I&#8217;m saying. But because it&#8217;s very easy to kind of let these things go at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>27:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you at some point, were proficient in all of what is considered 21st-century skills, sometimes our skills don&#8217;t get used very much. And so we lose track of them. And we don&#8217;t know, or we don&#8217;t know how to teach them to other people and various ways to do that. So I hope that when we revisit this in the time capsule of the internet 20 years from now, we can say that was a great explanation. And we learned so much. And we made so many changes in such progress that now we need a new version of this. That&#8217;s really all we can do, always striving to leave the world in a better position than when we found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>28:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that brings us to our small list of big things. I don&#8217;t have a ton to share with you today. But what I do have to share with you is a really big deal. So we are about a week away from the Go/No-Go point of WordPress 5.9. That is the final release of the year. And as soon as we know what is a go or a no go from that meeting on October 12th,&nbsp; everyone is going just to hit the ground running. And so, if you are interested in contributing to that release, either by being a participant in the release squad or leading some part of the release squad. Absolutely. Drop by and let me know because I am interested to know who wants to learn more about doing that. And this is actually something that has gone by. I mentioned at the top that I spoke at WordCamp US.&nbsp; That is still true; I did do it. And so did a bunch of other really excellent presenters. If you missed WordCamp US on Friday, for whatever reason, because you know, life is complicated. Pretty soon, we will have the videos. We&#8217;ll have all the videos up with captions quickly and have those available for everyone to watch and learn more from as their schedule allows and as their attention allows. And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphos, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"People of WordPress: Yordan Soares\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/people-of-wordpress-yordan-soares/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:14:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"heropress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:160:\"To coincide with International Translation Day, we feature the story of a WordPress developer and translator Yordan Soares from South America. #ContributorStory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14398:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people&#8217;s lives for the better.

He had not expected to find a whole global movement behind the web development software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan, who is from Venezuela, South America, said: “The first time I used WordPress, I had no idea what was going on behind the software or beyond it. I knew there was someone making it all work, but I couldn’t even remotely imagine all the people who were making WordPress not just a tool for developing websites, but a whole movement that comes together to share, build, and help make the world better.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning your hobby into your job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Yordan earned his income from computer technical support and installing networks for small and medium-sized businesses. Back in 2005, web development and code-writing was just a hobby. When he discovered the concept of CSS and how it could make everything dynamic. This opened up a whole new career pathway for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, an introduction to WordPress through a friend opened up a future he had not imagined. He stopped using any other content management system (CMS) and wanted to explore how much he could do with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years later in 2013, he was able to take his WordPress journey further by starting a small advertising agency with some of his friends. During this time, they crafted commercials for local radio and TV stations. Through WordPress, they found it easy to build more than 15 websites for businesses in a market that previously had not valued the importance of having an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “We were working for almost four years until at the end of 2017 the economic crisis in Venezuela became too acute, and we decided to close the agency when we stopped making profits. Taking stock of that period, I think we changed the way merchants saw the Internet business in the city.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working full time as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One year on in 2018, Yordan began to freelance full-time as a web developer. His first clients were primarily agencies and friends who had emigrated to other countries. Later, he expanded into freelance marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, getting started as a freelancer was quite a challenging task in Venezuela. The first hindrance was getting a fair level of recompense. Additionally, the deteriorating conditions in the country with constant blackouts and internet connection failures complicated matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Yordan was living in Guarenas, where the situation was relatively better. He managed to get a reasonably uninterrupted electricity supply with adequate internet speed, which was just good enough to complete his projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Surely if I hadn’t met the community, I would have continued to work on my own, like a lone wolf, doing the ordinary work of solving problems for occasional customers and paying my bills,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Guarenas, Yordan began to experience stability in his career and made new friends and contacts. He began looking for co-working spaces or technology communities nearby, and that’s when he met the WordPress community in Caracas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quickly signed up for the first face-to-face event. As soon as the event concluded, he went to talk to the co-organizer and offered his help. He was inspired to help with designing promotional pieces, managing social networks, and organizing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such events, he met and connected with several people living in nearby cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:32% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"120\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1-120x300.png?resize=120%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup logo \" class=\"wp-image-11300 size-medium\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?resize=120%2C300&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1.png?w=240&amp;ssl=1 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 120px) 100vw, 120px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> A few months later, with other WordPress users in the area, the idea emerged to start a new Guarenas-Guatire meetup group. The idea became a reality by December 2019, when they applied to the WordPress community team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final approvals came in, the team started scheduling the activities. The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-meetup-guarenas-guatire/\">WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup</a> was officially recognized!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter of 2020, just before the pandemic, Yordan and colleagues organized five face-to-face events. With the worldwide lockdown, in-person community engagements came to a halt. However, the Guarenas-Guatire community was eager to continue meeting.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the community active and motivated, and with the support of sponsors, they started organizing online events under a format called “WordPress a la medianoche” (WordPress at midnight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of these events was inspired by Alexis Arnal, who suggested meeting at midnight to make the most of the internet speed that would usually improve somewhat after that time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Yordan and the team have organized 16 WordPress a la medianoche events with an attendance of up to 50 people per online gathering. An impressive audience which enabled a comparatively small meetup to keep communications flowing at a difficult and unprecedented time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive of such events, is an opportunity to invite people from other countries and run sessions in partnership with others. An example was a special translation event with Javier Esteban, a member of the translation team from Spain. The meetup also invited contributors from Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia who were happy to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strengthened by the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=632%2C241&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Screenshot from the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events streamed on YouTube featuring Yordan\" class=\"wp-image-11307\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1024%2C390&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C114&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C292&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=1536%2C585&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1889&amp;ssl=1 1889w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Yordan (pictured bottom left) speaking at the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan believes that he would have continued to work on his own had he not met the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Fortunately, this was not the case and I have been able to live a lot of transforming experiences that have shown me the meaning of the words &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan felt empowered by the community and it led him to volunteer for many other roles and activities, including Locale Manager for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es-ve/\">Spanish Venezuela</a>, a moderator for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, and as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">support</a> contributor in the forums helping people with technical issues. He has also developed free plugins for the official WordPress directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/yordan-soares/\">spoken at community events</a> including <a href=\"https://spain.wordcamp.org/2020/session/actualizaciones-automaticas-para-tus-plugins-y-temas-personalizados/\">WordCamp Spain 2020</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this has a boomerang effect, Yordan explains. These experiences helped him grow personally and professionally, as it’s always rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also likes being able to directly help people when they need it and feels it is a two-way learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At first, when I told my family and friends about the community and the work I was doing, they would ask me &#8216;what do you get in return?&#8217; Perhaps they expected me to tell them a specific amount of money, but the answer is more complex,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem, the tool you use to work and put food on the table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his journey, Yordan has met many wonderful people with common interests and values, and the best part is that many of these people are now his friends, business partners, or customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, he has learned new skills and gained experience, which have given him a significant confidence boost in facing difficult situations that may come in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=632%2C332&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglots special appreciation poster featuring Yordan Soares. \" class=\"wp-image-11320\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=1024%2C538&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=768%2C403&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/join-us-for-wordpress-translation-day-global-events-in-september-2021/\">WordPress Translation Day 2021</a> celebrations, Yordan was nominated for his contribution to the work of the Polyglots Team translating WordPress.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m going to take you through a quick look at the final WordPress release of 2021. It will be WordPress 5.9. And there will be a ton of things in it, including a fresh new default theme. And there are a few things that you need to know about it right now. The target release date is December 14, 2021, which means some of our milestones happen around Thanksgiving in the US. And a few significant commercial dates globally, days, like Giving Tuesday and Black Friday, etc. I&#8217;ll include a link to the post with all the target dates in the show notes so that you can plan with those in mind. And also in the show notes. I&#8217;ll include a link to Matías Ventura&#8217;s post that includes the target features for the release. When you look at that post, you&#8217;ll notice that you can sort of group things into two big buckets. The two buckets that I grouped them into are themes plus tools, and also better tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bucket number one themes and all their tools. Three things were important for me as I was reading through them. Number one is that there is a default theme. As of the time of this recording, I&#8217;ve seen the early concepts for the theme, and I love them. Hopefully, by the time this podcast is published, the post that showcases the look and feel will also be up on make.wordpress.org/design. If it is, I&#8217;ll include a link in the show notes to make it easy for everyone to reference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is block themes in general. So WordPress 5.8 brought to core WordPress a lot of the infrastructure needed to create block themes. And in this release in WordPress 5.9, much of that infrastructure will be made available for folks who don&#8217;t always feel comfortable working in the code. That&#8217;s mostly UX and UI changes. So user experience and user interface changes are based on user feedback that we&#8217;ve gathered over the last six to eight months. But it also will include the long-awaited navigation block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that shows up for me in this first bucket, in the themes and all their tools bucket, is the UX and interface for theme.json. The user interface that we&#8217;re making available for theme.json is a major step forward in this project has been referred to as global styles for a few years. And it kind of is what it sounds like on the box, a way for users to tap into that powerful management tool that we have built through theme.JSON.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bucket number two, which I am calling publicly &#8220;tools for days.&#8221; But also, I refer to it as design tools, block tools, and pattern tools. I had this whole vision of a Wizard of Oz, “lions and tigers and bears. Oh my!” moment, but I couldn’t make it work. So “design tools and block tools and pattern tools Hoorah!” That&#8217;s as close as we&#8217;re getting. So that&#8217;s my first big number two bucket for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of these tools, the best way to describe it is quality of life improvements, lots of streamlining of what&#8217;s there, lots of building what&#8217;s not. But there&#8217;s one that&#8217;s substantial and worth digging into a bit more. And that&#8217;s the gallery block refactor. The dev note for this already exists. Like before we had the planning round-up post, the dev note was created. And so I will put a link to that in the show notes. But the headline is that this refactor will make the creation and maintenance of image blocks and the gallery block work the same way. If you are a theme or plugin developer, head on over to the dev notes that I have linked below and take some time to get familiar with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing, which has a bunch of small things in it, but will make a huge impact for all of our users overall, is that we&#8217;re working on more intuitive and responsive tools on blocks. That has come up frequently in our user testing again over the last six to eight months. And we are going to chip away at that long list of needs that we have in those particular toolsets. And that&#8217;s it. So that&#8217;s a really big broad look at what we&#8217;re trying to get into the final release of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp; know that when I say like this is our hoped for stuff. This is our best guess at the moment. Sometimes it can feel like we should know that already &#8212; I should know already what&#8217;s going into the release. And on the one hand, yes, I believe in this list of things that we&#8217;re going to put into the release, I think they&#8217;re going to be good. But I always refer to it as like the hoped-for things, the things that are on the roadmap, our best targets, because I know that I don&#8217;t ever want to ship something that is going to be a worse experience for users. And so I always like to save the space to be able to remove a feature or remove an enhancement, a little bit closer to the time of the release, just to make sure that what we are offering is the best that we can offer. However, as it says right there in the 19 learnings of open source, “if there&#8217;s a bug, there&#8217;s a job,” right? There&#8217;s a lot of tolerance in open source software for shipping, slightly imperfect work. And that&#8217;s good. When we ship software that&#8217;s a little bit imperfect, it makes it clear how everyone can participate, how everyone could participate, if they could find this WordPress community that supports the CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never participated in a release and are interested in learning how it goes, you can always follow along on make.wordpress.org/core. And of course, we do a lot of our meetings in the making WordPress, community Slack, which you can find at chat.wordpress.org if you are not already in that particular instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. I have three things on my list for you. The first one is WP Translation day slash month. For folks who&#8217;ve been following along for a bit, you probably noticed that Translation Day has been going on all month long all of September so that we can have small individual local events and bring people into the process of translating WordPress and making WordPress more usable for more people, especially when they don&#8217;t necessarily speak English as their first language. It&#8217;s a wonderful event. There&#8217;s been Translation Day at the end of September for years. And this Translation Month is working its way up to that Translation Day; I will leave a link to the event page in the notes below. And I really encourage you to drop by.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordCamp US is coming up on October 1. It is going to be a virtual event, as so many of our events are right now. Tickets are open. The schedule just got published last week. And so we have a good concept of who is talking about what while we&#8217;re there. I suggest you wander over to the schedule. Take a look at anything that might be inspirational to you or anyone who looks like they&#8217;re answering questions that you&#8217;ve had as you have been trying to build your WordPress business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things. Some of you may already be aware that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/andreamiddleton/\">Andrea Middleton</a> has left the WordPress project. She has been an absolute fixture in the WordPress open source project for the last ten years. And while we will all miss her terribly, her work has been so influential and so foundational that we actually won&#8217;t really feel much like she&#8217;s gone. We will see the evidence of her work in everything she does and everything she has done while we build a better and more inclusive WordPress after her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:47</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a final love letter to the community, she published a series of things that she learned about contributing to open source and especially how to contribute to WordPress as an open source project. I&#8217;m going to link those in the show notes as well. For anyone who has worked with Andrea for a long time, when you read it, it will just remind you of her voice and will be like a nice warm, comforting hug as she heads on to her next endeavors. And for folks who have never worked with her before. It&#8217;s still really excellent information that I think translates into all areas of our work, especially right now as people are moving to distributed work and remote work a bit more. Now I encourage everyone to at least give one or two of them a read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:38</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"11248\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Join us for WordPress Translation Day Global Events in September 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/09/join-us-for-wordpress-translation-day-global-events-in-september-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:51:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"polyglots\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"translation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11215\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"WordPress contributors around the world are celebrating the sixth Global WordPress Translation Day throughout September 2021! \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8447:\"\n<p>WordPress contributors around the world are <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">celebrating the sixth Global WordPress Translation Day</a> throughout the entire month of September!

Most work is being pushed toward the upcoming WordPress 5.9 release, which has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022\">postponed to January 25</a>. As a result, Gutenberg 12.0 has fewer bells and whistles and more bug fixes and maintenance. However, the latest update has a handful of enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most notable features are an overhaul of block styles previews, grouped paragraph typography options, and block icons in the global styles sidebar. The site editor also has a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36172\">welcome guide</a>, which should ship with WordPress 5.9 and introduce users to the new tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now opt-out of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36492\">core color palette and gradients</a>. There is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36852\">still a bug</a> where this does not currently work for the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-styles-previews\">Block Styles Previews</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Hovering a block style to see its preview.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For once in the last few years, the editor sidebar feels kind of clean and organized. When using a theme with multiple block styles, the style previews have been nothing short of an annoyance. The tab that held them took up a lot of space by presenting an entire demo of every option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the latest Gutenberg plugin release, the previews have been replaced with text-based buttons, emphasizing the style names. Users can still <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34522\">see what individual block styles look like</a> by hovering over each one or focusing on it with a keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside to this new experience is that longer block-style names can sometimes get cut off. For example, the &ldquo;Portfolio: Tilt Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;Polaroid: Tilt Right&rdquo; options in my custom theme both read &ldquo;Portfolio: Ti&hellip;&rdquo; I will have to rethink their names, but that is a small price to pay for the cleaner interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"paragraph-drop-cap-control-moved\">Paragraph Drop Cap Control Moved</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Drop cap control now under Typography tab.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It seems this release has been one for fixing those irritating issues with the user experience. The option for adding a drop cap to the Paragraph block now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36334\">rests alongside similar controls</a> under the Typography block options tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Formerly, users had to find it under a separate Text Settings tab, which only held the drop cap option. I am sure I have mentioned this being a poor user experience on a few occasions as someone who often reaches for the control. I, for one, am a happy camper with this change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"icons-shown-in-the-blocks-list\">Icons Shown in the Blocks List</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Blocks now show their icons.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">After the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-7-iterates-on-global-styles-improves-adding-navigation-links-and-adds-column-spacing\">Gutenberg 11.7 release</a>, one of my suggestions was to add icons to the global styles blocks list. Previously, it was a vertical scrollable area with dozens of block names, making it hard to find something specific to customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Nik Tsekouras, who wrote the patch for this change, happened to read that Tavern post or saw the same issue with his own experience, I am grateful that he <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36520\">coded a solution</a>. Finding a block is now much faster because I can just scan the list for a recognizable icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"themes-can-opt-into-all-appearance-settings\">Themes Can Opt Into All Appearance Settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For any theme author who has been working with <code>theme.json</code>, you know how unruly the file can get when enabling or disabling specific settings. A new flag allows themes to opt into <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36646\">support of all appearance-related options</a> at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An example <code>theme.json</code> file would look like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>{\n        \'version\': 2,\n        \'settings\': {\n                \'appearanceTools\': true\n        }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting the <code>appearanceTools</code> flag to <code>true</code> enables support for all border, color, spacing, and typography options. This should cut back on unnecessary JSON code, especially for themers who are opting into almost everything. Theme authors can still disable specific features individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the theme author&rsquo;s point of view, the potential up or downside to this new flag is that it will also enable support for other appearance-related features in the future. It would allow users to access new features before their themes officially support them. On the flip-side, theme authors may want more control or to run tests before enabling something new.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 23:15:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 21: All Things Block Themes!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11636\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/episode-21-all-things-block-themes/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26767:\"<p>In episode 21 of the WordPress Briefing, Executive Director, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, talks all things block themes with developers and theme specialists Maggie Cabrera and Jeff Ong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today, folks, in our podcast, I am joined by a couple of special guests. I know it&#8217;s been a bit since I&#8217;ve had a guest, so I&#8217;m very excited to introduce you to who I have with me today. Today, I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onemaggie/\">Maggie Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jffng/\">Jeff Ong</a>. They both are working on themes, and especially the future of themes as we move into this low code, no code block based experience of editing things in WordPress. And there have been so many questions lately about what does the landscape of being a theme developer turns into once we move fully into this excellent promise of user empowerment for Gutenberg? I figured who best to come and talk to us about that than these two. So welcome, Maggie. Welcome, Jeff. I&#8217;m really excited to have this conversation with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>01:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having us. Excited to be here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just gonna hop right in, and we will see what happens. The first thing that I want to chat about, I hear so many questions and so much discussion about patterns in a lot of different places. Like obviously, the work that I helped to steward the most is around like the Block Pattern directory and various other user-facing tools. And so I have never really been able to give a really solid answer about like patterns and how they work inside themes. And so I wondered if you all had anything that you could offer to our listeners to help clarify what is the power of patterns inside themes in the future? Implementation of themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>02:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can try to start unless, Maggie? Okay. Well, if you take a look at what I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of months working on Twenty Twenty-Two. And if you look at that theme, it&#8217;s mostly just the collection of patterns. Patterns. As you know, if you read the description, the theme, it&#8217;s designed to be the most flexible and kind of like flexible theme ever, dare I say ever created.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you can dare to say it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>03:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I think a huge part of that is because of the Full Site Editing being launched, introduced in 5.9. And also that theme itself ships with all of these patterns in it that work with the overall design, but really can be configured to your own kind of unique liking and kind of taste and ultimately, what you want to accomplish, whether that&#8217;s I want to make a portfolio, I want to make, you know, a single-page website promoting like my podcast, or there are patterns for that kind of shipping with the theme. And they&#8217;ve all been kind of designed and tailored to work with the typography choices at a baseline level with the color choices at a baseline level, but can very easily be tweaked. And you can kind of rely on them to work with the editor. And I guess, kind of zooming out for a little bit, not just about Twenty-Twenty Two. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like patterns as this idea that a theme, hopefully, what it is, it&#8217;s a collection of different design options or layout options that are ultimately presented as patterns to the user, the patterns are just a really easy way to basically say &#8220;I want you this layout, like two columns of text or with like some images here.&#8221; Basically, a theme becomes a way of packaging the patterns together in a way that feels like a coherent piece of a coherent website. And I think that&#8217;s a pretty powerful idea. I know that the patterns directory is also opening up making those patterns pretty widely available. But I think a theme you could think of as like a curation of those patterns in a way that makes sense. And I think Twenty-Twenty Two is a really good example. I mean, I&#8217;m biased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s a good example. Maggie, did you have anything that you wanted to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>05:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, What I really like about patterns is how it empowers the user, even if they don&#8217;t really have like a deep knowledge of code, or they&#8217;re not used to the more complex blocks. When the theme developer gives you this pattern about using the query block, for example, it lays out your posts in a very compelling manner. And you can edit it if you want it or just use it out of the box. And you have this dynamic blog that it&#8217;s, like, such a big important part of your website. Like if you want to have a page where you have, you have maybe a podcast website, and you want to showcase your podcasts differently than your regular blog posts. So you can use a different gray pattern for that. And it&#8217;s like, really, really easy to use, even if you&#8217;re not familiar with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have found compelling about this new version of themes and kind of the way that themes are planning to look in the future; it&#8217;s going to be like a super throwback, so everyone get ready for me to sound old, my guests and my listeners alike. It reminds me of my original days of blogging on the web. I was not a developer and even though I had this really short stint of working with JavaScript in my career, at some point. Like no one actually would ever look to me and be like, that one is excellent at design and fixing everything with code, like I was just killer at searching for the right pieces of code, right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I remember sitting there on Zynga, which is, of course, now powered by WordPress, I absolutely just went out and found bundles of code that are now what we would consider themes and modified the small pieces that I needed to change in order to like really suit what I wanted to have happen on the site at the time. And they&#8217;re like, I knew I could break it all. Really easily. But also, it was, it was not scary to think about breaking it. Like it was clear how I could fix it if I really broke it. The content, like what I had written, was separate from everything to do with the way that it was looking. And so like, I wouldn&#8217;t destroy all of my work, just because I didn&#8217;t put a semicolon in the right place, or whatever it was in that moment. And so like, this future of themes really reminds me of this a lot where someone has curated how it can look how it should look. And you can just like add in modular pieces that will augment what was already intended, but still kind of work. And if it&#8217;s not gonna work, it&#8217;s kind of easy to fix too. So like, I&#8217;m excited. That was a really exciting time in my learning of the web and certainly was formative in my career, as we all now see. And so yeah, I think that&#8217;s really exciting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did have actually another question that this conversation has kind of brought up for me. I have, obviously just use the term modular, which no one has ever used in the context of themes for WordPress. And I know that there is a lot there are a lot of terms kind of wandering around about themes right now. And especially as we&#8217;re moving into what themes can look like in the future. There was block based theme as a term for a while. And now it&#8217;s block themes. There was like this floating around the term, universal themes. And now we&#8217;re looking at just like block themes forever. And so I wondered if y&#8217;all could give us a just like a clear understanding of these terms that had been being used and maybe are going out of fashion? Like, are they important for us to keep knowing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, the history of terms around themes. And obviously, even my knowledge only goes back so far. But it was around when we started doing the block based themes meeting. And trying to I think that&#8217;s where that term kind of came from is like, oh, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start talking about this idea that themes can be completely made up out of blocks. And what does that mean?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>09:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think over time, it wasn&#8217;t just block themes, because, you know, previously, there were themes and even default themes that used and took into account the fact that blocks existed. So there was some confusion there. Enough time has gone on where we focus on this idea that themes whose templates are ultimately made out of blocks are block themes. And to me, it&#8217;s kind of as simple as that. Its themes that supply a set of templates that previously in the past were a collection of PHP and various template tags and whatnot is all transitioned to themes made up including other blocks, as well as themes that supply styles through theme.json configuration instead of supplying it in raw CSS. To me this idea is really crystallizing around like this is a block theme, one that is really, at its core, supplying a set of templates, and styles through a language that WordPress understands natively, and can allow it to be configured and customized in a really powerful way. And then maybe someday in the future, they&#8217;ll just be called themes again. If we do a good enough they will just be called themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna, I&#8217;m gonna take us into a philosophical area now that you&#8217;ve just put us in there. You said, someday they&#8217;ll be called Themes. Again, I&#8217;ve talked about this on this podcast a few times. And for anyone who&#8217;s worked with me for any length of time, like you all probably heard this from me as well. But like, adjectives are so frequently the realm of things that are not what you expect, right? Because like you have coffee, and then decaf coffee, no one&#8217;s like caffeinated coffee, because that&#8217;s what you expect out of it. And so when you&#8217;re like themes, and block themes, it makes it look like block themes are secondary, which at the moment, they are, ish. But in the future, I think you&#8217;re probably right, there will be a time when the modifier isn&#8217;t necessary anymore because it will be hopefully a much better way for people to kind of change the way that their themes work and make it more usable for users and people who are, you know, having to manage their own site without necessarily wanting to or being able to, like, have a Maggie in the room to fix everything that they break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:08</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie is nowhere near me. And so she&#8217;s never been in the room when I&#8217;ve broken anything. But I believe that Maggie on one occasion, at least, has come in and helped me fix something that I definitely broke. I&#8217;m an excellent breaker of WordPress things. Maggie, did you have anything you wanted to add to that question? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>12:29</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I guess, maybe clarify a bit, what universal themes are because, yeah, maybe some people have heard about the term but they don&#8217;t really know what they are. And maybe just clarify that. The term was born when developing block themes wasn&#8217;t something that you could actually do for production websites like you could build them to test some experiments, but they weren&#8217;t really ready for users to use. So universal themes want to grasp the power of love themes while still being ready for users. So the way they do it is they are block based, like we used to call them in the sense that the templates are made of blocks. But they are also able to be customized using the customizer, which is the old way of customizing themes, instead of using the site editor. So they can have a balance between two worlds between the worlds of classic themes and block themes. But they are, at heart, a temporary concept. They are bound to be blocked themes in the future, but with maybe a foot in the past, where they can actually serve users who are not ready for full-on site editor. But they are bound to be full block themes in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:00</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a really interesting concept in there. So universal themes, it sounds like are basically kind of like an on-ramp for people who are not really ready to fully commit to this for any number of reasons. Like we never want to say that we know the reason that people would be a little bit shy to get started with this. But like it&#8217;s kind of like an on-ramp, it&#8217;s a safe way to get back to something that they do know, in the event that what they don&#8217;t know, really hinders their progress makes it hard for them to get the work done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I wouldn&#8217;t say that they are for people shyer to get into new stuff rather than developers who want to embrace the new stuff before it&#8217;s even really ready. They really want to embrace the power of the blocks instead of doing things the old way. But even if it&#8217;s not fully ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>14:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They still need to support the old way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>14:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like being backward compatible and being ready for any kind of user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly for developers, everyone who heard me just talking about how it was a great thing for users, ignore it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>15:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also good for users; If they feel secure in using the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think that there&#8217;s something important here that we certainly learned with the adoption of Gutenberg in 5.0. Right, which is that there is certainly one method of helping people to adopt things, which is to go like the art of war style, and kind of smash their rice pots and burn all their boats, like, that&#8217;s one way. Which works for a lot of companies in the world, I&#8217;m sure. But WordPress has always had kind of a commitment, not even kind of, has always had a commitment to backward compatibility. And like, we know that a lot of the work on Gutenberg is going to represent some breaking changes around the around workflows and around the user experience the interface, especially like, we know that. But the opportunity to like have a thing that gives you an early taste of what&#8217;s coming but also the ability to keep kind of working in your old space where you need to, I think it&#8217;s an excellent way to bring people forward into the future of things, I have never been a fan of the just like cut off all avenues and hope that they stay with your method because of course, like you can&#8217;t cut off all the methods. You can&#8217;t cut off all the ways people can get away from you. And even if we could, it wouldn&#8217;t be in line with how WordPress hopes to kind of help people through some tough stuff like making your first website is hard. If you are doing it as part of, an overall campaign that&#8217;s supposed to bring in leads for you or generate revenue like you don&#8217;t want to necessarily play with that in a way that could break things and be risky for you in the long term. So I think all the tools that we offer to help people kind of move forward with the technology move forward with the CMS as it&#8217;s moving forward, I think it&#8217;s really smart. And so universal themes are one of those things, but also not around to stay. As we move into non modified themes, just the word themes that happen to be based in blocks. If I&#8217;ve confused anyone, please email me at wpbriefing@wordpress.org. And tell me how I confused you. And I will do a follow-up to unconfuse everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So speaking of the way that we help people kind of move forward with WordPress and with the technology. So much has been done in the CMS in the past 12 months in the past 18 months to be able to move themes into this same future as the rest of the editor. Right. So like, for folks who have not been listening to me for the last five years, you may not know this. So I&#8217;m going to tell everybody now, like one of the pain points that Gutenberg overall is solving is the fact that you for a long time had to learn five different editing interfaces to get one thing done in WordPress, right. And so like the advent of blocks and moving it into more and more spaces in the CMS is intended to really flatten the editing experience by making the type of user interaction the type of workflow really similar across all of the editing interfaces in the CMS. And so themes are a natural extension of that, where we can take similar user patterns and workflows, and work them out into themes. So over the last 12 months or so probably a little bit more, there&#8217;s been a lot of work on the CMS to move us forward in that that is now enabling the work that we want to be able to do to move things forward ahead. And so, I mean, this is probably our last question. Is there anything that you all want to offer to people who maybe saw themes early on or saw Gutenberg early on and felt like this is just not for me, in that in that context of like, how far it&#8217;s moved ahead in the past 12 months or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>19:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re asking like, what in the last 12 months has maybe like really surprised me or like sticks out to me as something that like, Wow, look how far we&#8217;ve come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, yeah. So like, if you&#8217;re looking at what is the one thing that you saw in the last 12 months, that changed in the CMS that really enabled something wonderful for themes or from the other side of it. Like if someone had looked at themes or WordPress 18 months ago, and now they&#8217;re looking at it and seeing this new and different way to do things with the look and feel of their site, like what is one thing that they should be aware of? On either side of that question,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera&nbsp; </strong>20:05</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there&#8217;s more than one thing that has really evolved through this last year, year and a half. Like the maturity of some of the blocks is astounding now, like navigation blog, for example, was really bare-bones at the start and now it&#8217;s full potential, and it&#8217;s really looking really great. I would say the same thing about those days or the features on fire, like how basic it was at the start, was full potential. But now it&#8217;s really, really mature in terms of how much you can do with it. Like, I think the example, the perfect example of that is the work that <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kjellr/\">Kjell [Reigstad]</a> has done on Twenty-Twenty Two with the alternative theme.json files, where just changing that file basically feels like a new theme, with just the configuration and the styles. And without writing any CSS without changing any templates. It&#8217;s really, really amazing how that can turn into a reality. And it&#8217;s so easy for users to tinker with that if they want to. And it&#8217;s much easier than having to delve deep into CSS and changing everything in like 2000 lines of code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeff Ong&nbsp; </strong>21:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I probably would echo most of that. What the thing that astounds me is global styles and how the UI can be shipping a theme or default theme with basically like, 20 lines of CSS, and have it be one of them. A beautiful, beautiful, like crisp and sharp, like, experience. It&#8217;s super fast. And it&#8217;s like, what this is a theme, you know, I thought a theme was supposed to supply all the styles like no, like, it&#8217;s just yeah. And workers do for you. Exactly. And like that. That&#8217;s pretty amazing to think in the last 12 months, we can go from, you know, shipping 1000s of lines of CSS to you none, it&#8217;s like, Wow, pretty cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, my friends, thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a really interesting conversation. I hope that all y&#8217;all out listening. Also find it interesting. As I mentioned, if you have any follow-up questions, absolutely. Send them to me via email. And I collect all of my questions that I get through the year for answering at the end of the year, mostly because I don&#8217;t get lots of questions that people want to be answered on this. Everyone just asked me their questions on Twitter and in Slack, which is fine as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Maggie, Jeff, thank you both for joining me. And I&#8217;m sure that we&#8217;ll talk to you all again soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. In the last episode, I got all excited about being in the beta phase. But today, I&#8217;m rolling that back a little bit. As part of our usual open source processes, a group of contributors did a deep dive review on the WordPress 5.9 release and found a workflow that needed some refinement. So we are delaying the beta. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we are in the midst of a major commerce slash/sales season, and of course, a lengthy holiday season, that delay also means that it makes sense to delay WordPress 5.9 final release a little as well. And so we are delaying that all the way into 2022 to January 25. For me, the trade-off works really well there. Every decision that we make in open source, of course, has some balance to it. It&#8217;s great for these aspects, it is less great for these aspects over here. But for myself, the opportunity to make sure that we have a really excellent experience for our users and also an opportunity to kind of avoid all of the chaos and hustle and bustle of the end of the year. Really, it seemed like a no-brainer for me. So in case you want to learn a little bit more about why we made the decision and get some insight into the actual milestones and where they have moved now, I&#8217;ll include some posts in the show notes below in case you want to read more and of course, if you have any additional questions you can always ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second small list of big things is that the first back to people WordCamp. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re calling it. Our first back to people WordCamp is happening in a couple of weeks actually. WordCamp Sevilla is happening in person on December 11. And I&#8217;m so excited I wish I were local, but I&#8217;m not so if you are local stop by their website and pick up your ticket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our smallest a big things is that it is, of course, charitable giving season. I don&#8217;t know if you do your charitable giving at the end of the year or if that&#8217;s even part of your general ways of giving back. But I can think of two or three charitable organizations inside the WordPress ecosystem. There&#8217;s of course the WordPress Foundation, but also Big Orange Heart and HeroPress. If there are others out there, I certainly do want to know about them. WordPress Foundation also does additional giving on behalf of just like the open web and open source as a whole. So if you&#8217;re the sort of person who does their charitable giving at the end of the year, just a reminder that you have some options inside the WordPress ecosystem if you were trying to figure out some new places to donate to in 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you so much for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. Thank you again to our special guests, Maggie and Jeff. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:07:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #56 – Gutenberg 12.0, WordPress 5.9 Release Schedule, Navigation Block and Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=19715\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-56-gutenberg-12-wordpress-5-9-ryan-welcher/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6547:\"<p>Co-hosts, Birgit Pauli-Haack and Grzegorz Ziolkowski discuss with Ryan Welcher the Gutenberg 12.0 release, the updated WordPress 5.9 Release Schedule and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li><li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li><li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li><li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paulisystems.net/wordpress-consulting\">Pauli Systems</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-56-Gutenberg-12-wordpress-5.9-Ryan-Welcher#shownotes\">Show Notes </a>/ <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-56-Gutenberg-12-wordpress-5.9-Ryan-Welcher#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-19715\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/\">Gutenberg Changelog</a>&nbsp;podcast via your favorite podcast apps!</strong><br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/620NwVKQJGdTupy36zYxvg?mc_cid=4b6c9f88fe\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9ndXRlbmJlcmd0aW1lcy5jb20vZmVlZC9wb2RjYXN0\">Google</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gutenberg-changelog/id1469294475\">iTunes</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pca.st/podcast/f8445ec0-7508-0137-f267-1d245fc5f9cf\">PocketCasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/gutenberg-changelog\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|<br />🎙️&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/chi7j-9904a/Gutenberg-Changelog-Podcast\">Pod Bean</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://castbox.fm/channel/Gutenberg-Changelog-id2173375\">CastBox</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/gutenberg-changelog-878239/\">Podchaser</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/podcast\">RSS Feed</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"ryan-welcher-developer-advocate-sponsored-by-automattic\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanwelcher\"><strong>Ryan Welcher</strong></a>, Developer advocate, sponsored by Automattic. </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ryanwelchercodes\">Twitch Live Streams @ ryanwelchercodes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-examples\">Gutenberg Examples Repository at GitHub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ryanwelcher.com/\">Website &amp;

Beta 1 was supposed to be released on November 16th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After careful weighing a few aspects of contributor sanity, user expectations, and technical details, the release team decided to punt Beta 1 for two weeks and release it on November 30th, 2021. Because of the Holidays mostly in America and Europe, these two weeks delay resulted into a six-weeks postponement of the final release, now scheduled for January 25th, 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core release lead <strong>Tonya Mork</strong> has the details about the  <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/11/22/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-schedule/\"><strong>WordPress 5.9 Revised Release Schedule</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong>, release co-lead for testing, wrote in <a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2021/11/23/why-i-voted-to-delay-wordpress-5-9/\"><strong>Why I voted to delay WordPress 5.9</strong></a>, her hope &#8220;is to bring you all along for the decision-making process and to demystify how this decision came to be.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding </strong>over the WPTavern posted: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022\"><strong>WordPress 5.9 Revised Release Date Confirmed for January 25, 2022</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2021&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on.

As he also worked on the release of this version, we heard first hand what the experience is like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most contributors worked on the final touches for the WordPress 5.9 Beta 1 Feature Freeze, there are no big new features expected in this version. This version is more about the small details that end up making a big difference in the overall user experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting updates: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Block Styles Previews (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34522\">34522</a>),</li><li>Featured Image block Visual Enhancement in the Site Editor (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36517\">36517</a>), </li><li>the Site Editor Welcome Guide (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36172\">36172</a>) and </li><li>the updates to the JSON schemas for <a href=\"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/block.json\"><strong>block.json</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\">theme.json</a></strong>. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The changelog  has a new section called <strong>Developer Experience.</strong> It lists the PRs that are relevant to WordPress extenders (plugin &amp; theme developers and developers working in agencies) as well as core contributors.

My name is Daniel Kossmann. I&#8217;ve been WordPress user since 2009, one of the organizers of the Curitiba community, creator of the weekly newsletter called PainelWP, and a regular writer about WP in my blog. This is my before and after story from joining the WordPress community in Brazil. Happy reading!</p>\n<h2>First contacts with the internet</h2>\n<p>Since I was a kid I was very fond of computers and video games, but the internet opened a whole new world for me. I was so fascinated that at eleven years, around 1998, reading tutorials and analyzing HTML codes I created my first website on James Bond, of whom I was a big fan. In those first years, even though my parents didn&#8217;t quite understand what I was doing and why I was spending so much time in front of the computer, they backed me up by purchasing books and computers.</p>\n<p>Little by little I learned more about programming and developing my systems in ASP and only then PHP. Since there weren&#8217;t so many websites teaching programming, I created a series of websites that taught others how to create websites and add small functionalities for them, like counters, login area, blinking text, &#8230;. At that time, I even created a content management system, that could receive contributions through a form and automatically published them every day at a given time, with a countdown timer in the website telling visitors when the next update would occur. This may be seen as trivial today, but at that time it was very uncommon. Those were really fun days, where I spent several nights learning new things and talking to other people who had the same interest in IRC on the deceased Brasnet network. If you are curious to learn more, check out <a href=\"https://belohorizonte.wordcamp.org/2016/daniel-kossmann-ferraz-automacao/\">my interview at WordCamp Belo Horizonte 2016</a> (content in Portuguese).</p>\n<h2>First contact with WordPress</h2>\n<p>When the time came to choose my undergraduate, there was no doubt that it would be something related to computers. So I chose a Computer Science degree from Federal University from Parana (UFPR). During college, I also wanted to dabble in other fields, so I decided to create a blog in which to write movie reviews. Looking for a platform in which to easily publish texts, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about coding because I already was doing this every day at school, I discovered WordPress. It didn&#8217;t take long and, in 2009, I launched my first public blog about movies, which after one year became <a href=\"https://www.interrogacao.com.br/\"><i>interrogAção</i></a> (content in portuguese), a cultural hub on cinema, literature, and comics, with collaborators from several cities in Brazil. As in the case with my first tutorial websites and IRC conversations, many of these people I only knew virtually, but we had an intense contact while exchanging know-how.</p>\n<p>Even though my focus was more on content creation and editorializing, I began to learn more about how to create themes and features in WordPress to customize the website. In one of these researches, I found out that an event focused on WP was going to happen in my city. Even not knowing a lot about the platform, I decided to attend and learn more.</p>\n<h2>First contact with the community</h2>\n<p>The event was <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2010/\">WordCamp Curitiba 2010</a> (content in portuguese) and I still remember how amazed I was at it being so cheap, I think it was R$60 or less, offering so many souvenirs and snacks. Other tech events I had attended had always charged more than double and hadn&#8217;t offered half of these things.</p>\n<p>The talks were amazing, and everyone was always very kind and available. I was so excited about everything that I promised myself that I would volunteer during the next edition and also try to be a speaker. As I didn&#8217;t know anyone at the event, I challenged myself to talk with at least three people — I was extremely shy back then. Since then two of them have become lifelong friends.</p>\n<p>At the end of the event, I found out that there was an after-party called WordCana (a joke with the word &#8220;cana&#8221;, from sugarcane, that is used to make distilled spirit). Even though I didn&#8217;t drink alcohol, I decided to go and it was awesome! There, I got to know the event&#8217;s speakers, organizers and attendees. Everyone talking as equals. And the fact that I didn&#8217;t drink alcohol didn&#8217;t change at all my interaction with them.</p>\n<h2>From attendee to WordCamp organizer</h2>\n<p>The promise I had made during that event came true! Less than two years later, I was helping to organize the next edition, <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2012/\">WordCamp Curitiba 2012</a> (content in portuguese), which was where I also gave <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2012/10/11/daniel-kossmann-ferramentas-livres-para-desenvolvimento-wordpress/\">my first public talk</a> (content in portuguese). I was still very shy and, during the talk, I was so nervous that I couldn&#8217;t hold the microphone near my mouth. Because of that, even though it was a small room, people were having a hard time listening to my voice. Nevertheless, it was an important overcoming experience that has kept me desiring to improve my public speaking skills for future talks to this day.</p>\n<h2>From user to entrepreneur</h2>\n<p>Since I was a kid I had dreamt about opening my own company. Therefore, when I graduated in 2011, as I have always liked creating websites, I had little doubts about my next step: creating a web development company. I named it Spirallab, because of my passion for spirals and imagining turning it into a creative project lab. In the beginning, I didn&#8217;t define a direction and I worked with various systems and programming languages. Soon I realized that giving maintenance to these different solutions was a lot of work. So I opted to use a single platform, WordPress, due to its ease of use for my clients and the possibility to create various types of websites.</p>\n<p>This decision allowed me to dive even deeper into the system, making better and faster-to-deliver solutions for my clients. As time went by, I also increased my services within the platform, adding support, maintenance, courses, consulting and optimized hosting for WordPress, which at that time was extremely hard to find. This allowed for a broader client range. It also enabled us to specialize in the platform, getting to better know all of its facets.</p>\n<p>Even being a small company, never going beyond four people, I made sure to find ways to contribute to the WordPress community. After all, I managed to support my business without paying a single cent to use the platform. That is why I sponsored several WordCamps and meetups. This created a curious situation: Spirallab&#8217;s name was side by side with other sponsors that had 10 to 50 times its size. I wondered why there weren&#8217;t more companies doing the same. The sponsorship quotas started with a very low price tag, sometimes R$250. Considering the annual revenue of a company that uses WP as its main solution, I believe that this cost or investment could be easily included in its annual budget. I wish more companies, regardless of their size, would do that.</p>\n<p>Besides that, I&#8217;ve talked at several meetups and WordCamps, where I shared what I learned in my day-to-day life. It was always and still is a big pleasure to be able to make these contributions. During the events, I gave away some stickers from my company that had an illustration of a digital alchemist (a kind of modern wizard). Because of that, and my looks (long hair and beard), I ended up being nicknamed the WordPress Wizard.</p>\n<p>Eight years after Spirallab&#8217;s foundation, I decided to close the company&#8217;s activities and start a new chapter at <a href=\"https://www.pipefy.com/\">Pipefy</a> in 2019, where I currently work as a WordPress Development Coordinator.</p>\n<h2>The return of Curitiba&#8217;s WordPress Community</h2>\n<p>After WordCamp 2012, Curitiba&#8217;s community became inactive. But the urge to continue with the events stayed with me. It took me three years to take the first step. So I got in touch with other people from the Brazilian community that I had met at WordCamp, to find out what was needed to restart the meetings, which are called meetups, in Curitiba. Coincidentally, I found out three people who wanted to do the same and we started planning the event through Slack, a text chat software. In less than a month, we organized the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/wpcuritiba/events/224130389/\">first event</a>, on August 5, 2015. The most curious thing was that we were able to do all of the planning virtually, and only met for the first time in person on the day of the event.</p>\n<p>Due to the speed in which we were able to organize this event, it may seem that we already had experience with this type of organization, but in fact, we didn&#8217;t have much, if any. So the first thing we asked ourselves was, &#8220;What would be nice to have included in the event if we were attendees?&#8221;. And two things stood out: having food and fun. So we ordered food (pizza, for convenience) and we tried to make something funner and without many formalities. We didn&#8217;t want to have those events where hardly anyone talks to anyone and after the talk, everyone leaves like they&#8217;re running away from something.</p>\n<p>Keeping anyone from feeling lost, we made a brief presentation with slides at the beginning of the meetup, explaining what the event was and how it was organized, asking everyone to introduce themselves. This structure was maintained during all future events. Little by little, we carried out several experiments, such as a section where everyone could share news, themes, or plugin tips, or a classified section, where people could say if they were looking for or offering a particular service. Among the organizers, we always pre-arranged tips to be shared, in order to encourage others to participate. At first, few people engaged, but over time, they ended up becoming an important part of the event.</p>\n<p>As I was extremely shy, getting in front of people to introduce the meetup was not easy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very nervous and ended up speaking very low, even stuttering a little. I wanted to change that and knew that the only way was to practice. I believe the meetup is a great place for this, as it is a small group of people with a common interest: learning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This makes everyone more receptive, creating a safe environment to participate in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>By the way, this is something very important to me: making the events an environment where everyone feels welcome and safe to ask questions and share experiences. Therefore, I always welcome new participants and encourage them to participate and talk to other people. Sometimes I retell the story of my first WordCamp, where I challenged myself to talk to three strangers.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, although I&#8217;m still a reserved person, I&#8217;m not so shy anymore and can speak in public without as much difficulty. Because of this personal achievement, whenever possible, I encourage others to give their first talk and also share all the tips I used, and still use, to make better presentations. I get very happy when I see people overcoming these challenges and growing personally and professionally. Despite having changed a lot, I still set a personal challenge to always do something to take me out of my comfort zone in each and every talk. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t have the expected effect, but at least I have one more funny story to tell.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been more than six years since the first meetup (there was even a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhYqoPaRsPo\">commemorative video</a>) and throughout this time the WordPress community in Curitiba has held monthly events. I confess that it is not easy to maintain this consistency, but it is very rewarding!</p>\n<h2>From developer to WordPress content creator</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed reading technology newsletters, but there weren&#8217;t any specific to WordPress in Brazil. After much contemplation (and procrastination) I decided to create a newsletter that prioritized the spreading of content in Portuguese. And, on June 22, 2019, I published the Zero edition of <a href=\"https://www.painelwp.com.br/\">PainelWP</a> (content in portuguese). Since then, I&#8217;ve searched and published the main news, tutorials, tips, events, and WordPress jobs weekly. My main goal with the newsletter is to inspire more people to create content about WP in Portuguese.</p>\n<p>As I learn a lot from reading tutorials and articles, this year (2021), I also started writing content regularly about WordPress on <a href=\"https://www.danielkossmann.com/category/wordpress/\">my blog</a> (content in portuguese). One of the publications I&#8217;m doing on behalf of PainelWP is to write about <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/\">how to use WordPress&#8217;s native PHP functions</a> (content in portuguese), with code examples. Writing regularly is quite challenging, but it&#8217;s very rewarding and I learn a lot. I recommend creating a blog and posting on it regularly to all professionals who want to improve their knowledge. One idea is to keep a record of what you are learning on the blog.</p>\n<p>In addition, all of this is published under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">Creative Commons BY-SA license</a>, almost an equivalent of free software license for content. I chose this license because it makes it easy for content to be shared and used, like the WordPress source code.</p>\n<h2>The Importance of the WordPress Community</h2>\n<p>I believe that the great advantage and differential of WordPress, in addition to the numerous plugins and themes available, is its community. Because it&#8217;s an open platform and makes it easy to create websites, it attracts people with very different technical levels and backgrounds. This diversity helps create an open space for exchange, where everyone has something different to teach.</p>\n<p>This creates a connection both online and in person. It&#8217;s very satisfying to meet people in person at community events. From these encounters, I&#8217;ve made several lasting friendships. These contacts also have helped me a lot professionally. I&#8217;ve received several job referrals from them and I&#8217;ve also referred several people.</p>\n<p>An important tip I&#8217;ve learned in the WordPress community is: every time you&#8217;re in a conversation circle during events, leave a free space for a new person to join the circle. This format is also called <a href=\"https://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/\">the Pac-Man Rule</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not yet part of the WordPress community, I recommend looking for a meetup in your city, or nearby, to join. There are also several community meetings online now, which is a great opportunity to exchange knowledge with people from other cities. Hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed my story and see you at the next meetup or WordCamp!</p>\n<h1 id=\"portuguese\">Histórias de um colaborador em série</h1>\n<p>Oi! Meu nome é Daniel Kossmann. Utilizo WordPress desde 2009, sou um dos organizadores da Comunidade de WordPress de Curitiba, criador da newsletter semanal PainelWP e escrevo regularmente sobre WP em meu blog pessoal. Esta é a minha história antes e depois de começar a participar da comunidade do WordPress do Brasil. Boa leitura!</p>\n<h2>Primeiros contatos com a internet</h2>\n<p>Desde criança já gostava bastante de computadores e videogames, mas a internet abriu um mundo totalmente novo para mim. Fiquei tão fascinado que aos 11 anos, por volta de 1998, lendo tutoriais e analisando códigos HTML criei o meu primeiro site (sobre James Bond, eu era um grande fã). Nesses primeiros anos, apesar de meus pais não entenderem direito o que eu fazia e porque passava tantas horas em frente ao computador, eles me apoiaram comprando livros e computadores.</p>\n<p>Aos poucos fui aprendendo mais sobre programação e criando meus próprios sistemas em ASP e depois em PHP. Como existiam poucos sites em português que ensinavam programação, criei vários sites que ensinavam outras pessoas a criarem sites e adicionar pequenas funcionalidades neles (como contadores, áreas de login, textos piscando, …). Nesta época, também cheguei a criar meu próprio gerenciador de conteúdo, que aceitava o envio de conteúdo por colaboradores através de um formulário e fazia a publicação automaticamente todos os dias em um determinado horário (com um contador no site avisando quando seria a próxima atualização). Isto pode parecer bem trivial hoje em dia, mas naquele tempo ainda não era nada comum. Esta foi uma época bem divertida, onde passei várias madrugadas aprendendo coisas novas e conversando com outras pessoas que tinham o mesmo interesse no IRC, na falecida rede Brasnet. Se você ficou curioso para saber sobre essa época, veja a <a href=\"https://belohorizonte.wordcamp.org/2016/daniel-kossmann-ferraz-automacao/\">entrevista que o WordCamp Belo Horizonte 2016 fez comigo</a>.</p>\n<h2>Primeiros contatos com o WordPress</h2>\n<p>Quando chegou a hora de escolher um curso superior, não tinha dúvidas que seria algo relacionado à computação. Então entrei no curso de Ciência da Computação na Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR). Durante a faculdade, também queria experimentar outras áreas e decidi criar um blog para escrever críticas de filmes. Procurando por uma plataforma que fosse fácil de publicar textos para que eu não tivesse que me preocupar com códigos (já via isso todo dia no meu curso), descobri o WordPress. Não demorou muito e em 2009 criei meu primeiro blog público sobre cinema, que depois de um ano se transformou no <a href=\"https://www.interrogacao.com.br/\">interrogAção</a>, um portal cultural sobre cinema, literatura e quadrinhos, com colaboradores de várias cidades do Brasil. Assim como nos meus primeiros sites de tutoriais, e conversas do IRC, muitas dessas pessoas eu só conhecia virtualmente, mas tínhamos um contato intenso de troca de conhecimento.</p>\n<p>Apesar do meu foco estar mais voltado para criação e editoração de conteúdo, comecei a aprender mais sobre como funcionava a criação de temas e funcionalidades no WordPress para poder personalizar o site. Em uma dessas pesquisas, descobri que iria acontecer um evento só sobre o WP na minha cidade. Mesmo não sabendo ainda muito sobre o sistema, decidi me inscrever para poder aprender mais.</p>\n<h2>Primeiro contato com a comunidade</h2>\n<p>O evento era o <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2010/\">WordCamp Curitiba 2010</a> e ainda lembro do quanto fiquei impressionado por ele ser tão barato (acho que foi R$60 ou menos), oferecer tantos brindes e ter lanches. Os outros eventos de tecnologia que havia participado sempre custaram mais que o dobro e não ofereciam nem metade dessas coisas.</p>\n<p>As palestras foram ótimas e todo mundo era sempre muito gentil e disponível. Fiquei tão empolgado com tudo, que prometi para mim mesmo que iria ajudar na próxima edição e também tentar palestrar nela. Como não conhecia ninguém no evento, defini como desafio pessoal falar com pelo menos três pessoas (eu era extremamente tímido). Duas delas acabaram se tornando amizades de longa data.</p>\n<p>No final do evento, descobri que haveria uma continuação chamada WordCana. Mesmo não gostando de beber, decidi ir e foi sensacional! Lá, conheci mais de perto os palestrantes, organizadores e participantes do evento. Todos falando de igual para igual. E o fato de não beber, não influenciou em nada minha interação com as outras pessoas.</p>\n<h2>De participante para organizador do WordCamp</h2>\n<p>A promessa que fiz durante o evento deu certo! Menos de dois anos depois, estava ajudando a organizar a próxima edição, o <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2012/\">WordCamp Curitiba 2012</a>. Nele também fiz <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2012/10/11/daniel-kossmann-ferramentas-livres-para-desenvolvimento-wordpress/\">minha primeira palestra pública</a>. Eu continuava sendo muito tímido e durante a palestra, fiquei tão nervoso que não conseguia deixar o microfone perto da boca. Por conta disso, mesmo em uma sala pequena, as pessoas tiveram dificuldades para me escutar. Mesmo assim, foi uma importante experiência de superação, que me ajudou a continuar querendo melhorar minhas habilidades de falar em público em futuras palestras.</p>\n<h2>De usuário para empreendedor</h2>\n<p>Desde criança sonhava em abrir minha própria empresa e como gostava de criar sites, quando me formei em 2011, não tive muitas dúvidas sobre qual seria meu próximo passo: abrir uma empresa que desenvolve soluções para a internet. Chamei ela de Spirallab, por conta da minha paixão por espirais e pensando em torná-la um laboratório para projetos criativos. No início não defini muito um foco e trabalhei com vários sistemas e linguagens de programação diferentes. Aos poucos percebi que a manutenção dessas diferentes soluções estava ficando muito trabalhosa. Decidi que deveria utilizar apenas uma única plataforma e escolhi o WordPress, porque era fácil de ser utilizado pelo cliente e permitia a criação de diversos tipos de sites.</p>\n<p>Esta decisão me permitiu aprofundar muito mais no sistema, fazendo com que criasse soluções melhores e mais rápidas de entregar para meus clientes. Conforme o tempo foi passando, também aumentei as opções de serviços oferecidos em volta da plataforma: suporte, manutenção, hospedagem otimizada para WordPress (na época era extremamente difícil achar algo assim), cursos e consultorias. Isto permitiu uma diversificação maior de clientes. Também possibilitou uma especialização na plataforma, conhecendo todos os aspectos que a envolviam.</p>\n<p>Mesmo sendo uma empresa pequena (nunca passou de 4 pessoas), fiz questão de encontrar maneiras de contribuir com a comunidade do WordPress. Afinal, eu estava conseguindo sustentar o negócio sem precisar pagar nenhum centavo para utilizar a plataforma. Por isso ajudei a patrocinar vários WordCamps e meetups. Isso criava uma situação curiosa: o nome da Spirallab ficava ao lado de outros patrocinadores que tinham 10 ou 50 vezes o tamanho dela. Ficava então me perguntando porque não haviam mais empresas fazendo o mesmo. As cotas desses patrocínios iniciavam com um valor bem baixo (muitas vezes em R$250). Se formos considerar o faturamento de uma empresa que utiliza o WP como solução principal, acredito que este custo (ou investimento) poderia ser facilmente adicionado ao planejamento anual. Gostaria muito que mais empresas, independente do tamanho, fizessem isso.</p>\n<p>Além disso, palestrei em vários meetups e WordCamps, onde compartilhei o que havia aprendido no meu dia a dia. Sempre foi (e ainda é) uma satisfação muito grande poder fazer estas contribuições. Durante os eventos eu distribuía um adesivo da minha empresa que tinha a ilustração de um alquimista digital (uma espécie de mago moderno). Por conta disto, e do meu visual (cabelo comprido e barba), acabei ganhando o apelido de o Mago do WordPress.</p>\n<p>Oito anos depois da fundação da Spirallab, decidi encerrar as atividades da empresa e iniciei um novo capítulo na <a href=\"https://www.pipefy.com/\">Pipefy</a> em 2019, onde trabalho atualmente como coordenador de desenvolvimento WordPress.</p>\n<h2>O retorno da Comunidade de WordPress de Curitiba</h2>\n<p>Depois do WordCamp 2012, a Comunidade de Curitiba ficou inativa. Mas a vontade de continuar com os eventos continuou na minha cabeça. Demorei três anos para dar o primeiro passo. Então entrei em contato com outras pessoas da comunidade brasileira que tinha conhecido no WordCamp, para saber o que era necessário para voltar a fazer os encontros (também chamados de <i>meetups</i>) em Curitiba. Por coincidência, descobri que mais três pessoas estavam querendo fazer o mesmo e começamos a planejar o evento através do Slack (software de bate papo em texto). Em menos de um mês, organizamos o <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/wpcuritiba/events/224130389/\">primeiro evento, no dia 5 de agosto de 2015</a>. O mais interessante foi que conseguimos fazer tudo isso virtualmente. Só no dia do evento que nós nos encontramos pessoalmente pela primeira vez.</p>\n<p>Pela velocidade que conseguimos organizar este evento, pode parecer que já tínhamos experiência neste tipo de organização, mas na verdade não tínhamos muita (ou nenhuma) experiência como organizadores. Por isso, a primeira coisa que nos perguntamos foi: o que seria legal ter, caso fossemos participantes? E duas coisas se destacaram: ter comida e ser divertido. Então pedimos comida (pizza, pela praticidade) e tentamos fazer algo mais divertido e sem formalidades. Não queríamos aqueles eventos onde quase ninguém fala com ninguém e depois da palestra todos vão embora como se estivessem fugindo de algo.</p>\n<p>Para que ninguém se sentisse perdido, no início do meetup fizemos uma breve apresentação com slides, explicando o que é o evento e como ele é organizado, pedindo para cada um se apresentar. Essa estrutura se manteve durante todos os próximos eventos. Aos poucos fomos fazendo vários experimentos. Desde uma seção onde todos podiam compartilhar uma notícia, dica de tema ou plugin, até um espaço para classificados, onde as pessoas poderiam dizer se procuravam ou ofereciam determinado serviço. Entre os organizadores, sempre combinamos previamente dicas para serem compartilhadas, de forma a estimular outras pessoas a participarem. No começo poucas pessoas participavam, mas com o tempo, estes momentos acabaram se tornando uma parte importante do evento.</p>\n<p>Como eu era extremamente tímido, ficar em frente a várias pessoas para apresentar o meetup não era nada fácil. Ficava muito nervoso e acabava falando bem baixo, até gaguejando um pouco. Queria mudar isso e sabia que o único jeito era praticar. Acredito que o meetup é uma ótima oportunidade para isto, por ser um grupo pequeno de pessoas com um interesse em comum: aprender. Isso faz com que todos sejam mais receptivos, criando um ambiente seguro para participar de várias formas.</p>\n<p>Aliás, isto é algo muito importante para mim: tornar os eventos um ambiente onde todas as pessoas se sintam bem vindas e seguras para fazerem perguntas e compartilharem experiências. Por isso, sempre dou boas vindas para os novos participantes e os incentivo a participarem e conversarem com outras pessoas do evento. Às vezes, conto a história do meu primeiro WordCamp, onde me desafiei a conversar com três pessoas desconhecidas.</p>\n<p>Hoje em dia, apesar de continuar sendo uma pessoa mais quieta, não sou mais tão tímido e consigo falar em público sem tanta dificuldade. Por conta desta superação pessoal, sempre que possível, incentivo outras pessoas a darem sua primeira palestra e também compartilho todas as dicas que utilizei (e ainda utilizo) para fazer melhores apresentações. Fico muito feliz quando vejo pessoas superando essas dificuldades e crescendo pessoalmente e profissionalmente. Apesar de ter mudado muita coisa, ainda utilizo como desafio pessoal fazer sempre algo para me tirar da zona de conforto em cada palestra (às vezes não tem o efeito esperado, mas pelo menos tenho mais uma história engraçada para contar).</p>\n<p>Já se passaram mais de seis anos desde o primeiro meetup (teve até um <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhYqoPaRsPo\">vídeo comemorativo</a>) e desde lá a comunidade de WordPress de Curitiba faz eventos mensalmente. Confesso que não é nada fácil manter essa consistência, mas é muito gratificante!</p>\n<h2>De desenvolvedor para criador de conteúdo sobre WordPress</h2>\n<p>Sempre gostei muito de ler newsletters sobre tecnologia, mas não havia nenhuma específica de WordPress no Brasil. Depois de muito contemplar (e procrastinar), decidi criar uma newsletter que priorizasse a divulgação de conteúdo em português. E, em 22 de junho de 2019, publiquei a edição zero do <a href=\"https://www.painelwp.com.br/\">PainelWP</a>. Desde lá, semanalmente procuro e divulgo as principais notícias, tutoriais, dicas, eventos e vagas de WordPress. Meu principal objetivo com a newsletter é inspirar mais pessoas a criarem conteúdo sobre WP em português.</p>\n<p>Como aprendo muito lendo tutoriais e artigos, também comecei a escrever regularmente este ano (2021) no <a href=\"https://www.danielkossmann.com/category/wordpress/\">meu blog conteúdo sobre WordPress</a>. Uma das publicações que estou fazendo por conta do PainelWP é escrever semanalmente sobre como utilizar <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/\">funções nativas em PHP do WordPress</a>, com exemplos de códigos. Escrever regularmente é bem desafiador, mas é muito gratificante e aprendo bastante. Recomendo a todos os profissionais que querem aprimorar seus conhecimentos, criar um blog e postar regularmente. Uma ideia é manter um registro do que você está aprendendo no blog.</p>\n<p>Além disso, tudo isso é publicado sob a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.pt_BR\">licença Creative Commons BY-SA</a>, quase um equivalente do software livre para conteúdo. Escolhi esta licença pois facilita que o conteúdo seja compartilhado e utilizado, assim como o código fonte do WordPress.</p>\n<h2>A importância da comunidade de WordPress</h2>\n<p>Acredito que a grande vantagem e diferencial do WordPress, além dos inúmeros plugins e temas disponíveis, é a sua comunidade. Por ser uma plataforma aberta e facilitar a criação de sites, ele atrai pessoas com vários níveis técnicos e históricos muito diferentes. Esta diversificação ajuda a criar um espaço aberto para trocas, onde cada um tem algo diferente para ensinar.</p>\n<p>Isto cria uma conexão que se dá tanto online quanto presencialmente. É muito gratificante encontrar pessoas pessoalmente em eventos da comunidade. A partir desses encontros, fiz várias amizades duradouras. Estes contatos também me ajudaram bastante profissionalmente. Já recebi várias indicações para serviços a partir deles e também já indiquei várias pessoas.</p>\n<p>Uma dica importante que aprendi na comunidade de WordPress é: toda vez que estiver em uma roda de conversa durante os eventos, deixe um espaço livre para que uma nova pessoa possa se juntar à roda. Este formato também é chamado de <a href=\"https://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/\">regra do Pac-Man</a>.</p>\n<p>Se você ainda não faz parte da comunidade de WordPress, recomendo procurar um meetup na sua cidade (ou próximo dela) para participar. Também há várias comunidades fazendo encontros online agora, que são uma ótima oportunidade de trocar conhecimento com pessoas de outras cidades. Espero que você tenha gostado da minha história e nos vemos no próximo meetup ou WordCamp!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 11:00:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Daniel Kossmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WordPress, Blogging, and the Things We Are Thankful For\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126085\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-blogging-and-the-things-we-are-thankful-for?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-blogging-and-the-things-we-are-thankful-for\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4246:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Saturday, one side of my family held our pre-Thanksgiving reunion. It had been two years since we were able to do it. I offered to host this year when our previous venue&rsquo;s loss threatened to sideline the event for yet another year. Needless to say, I was exhausted by the time my last cousin and his wife got in the car and drove off toward their home in south Alabama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunday, the day after, was the first relaxing day I had taken in weeks. But, I am not one for spending the entire day dedicated to watching TV &mdash; except when <em>Squid Game</em> was released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dusting off my rarely-used personal blog, I began to pen an update post on my National Novel Writing Month progress. Instead of actually doing that, at least until later in the night, I looked over years of published blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a rich history there, at least to me. My blog is a journal of my personal memories going back to 2003. For 18 years, I have been writing something, spitting out words into what can sometimes feel like an endless void. That na&iuml;ve 19-year-old kid who was just setting foot into the online world was not thinking he would still be doing the same thing all these years later. He was just blogging. It was one part an extension of the angst-ridden notebooks he had filled as a teen. It was another part of a new and exciting journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For around an hour or so, I simply clicked and read and clicked and read. It is an extraordinary time to be alive, to take part in this moment in history where anyone from all over the world could live those same memories with me. And I can read their blogs. I can read about their hopes and dreams, view galleries of their pets, or catch up on their goals for the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the reasons I subscribe to people&rsquo;s personal blog feeds more so than news or development sites. At the end of the day, everything we do here is about people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took a deep dive through my archives, caught up with some fun moments I had shared with the world, and read over some of my old WordPress development tutorials. I even scanned through my obsession with Marie Kond&#333;s tidying rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was only disappointed that there were many moments that I decided not to share. I perused some of the notes from unpublished drafts of various instances of #WPDrama, discussions where I decided to keep my thoughts to myself rather than rock the boat. I skipped over headlines for books I had read but never reviewed. I remembered some life-changing moments that I never bothered to even write a draft about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from reminiscing over the past half of my life, I realized that my blog is older than many people who are just starting their own blogging journeys. WordPress, which also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/happy-18th-birthday-wordpress\">turned 18 this year</a>, is older than its next generation of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also realized that I simply enjoy blogging. I had never given it much thought before &mdash; the <em>why</em> behind my continued participation in this artform. Perhaps it is because I have something I want to say from time to time. Maybe it is simply therapeutic. In the end, it might not matter. However, I am grateful that we have platforms like WordPress that allow us all to do it, regardless of our reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we close shop for the week for some much-needed rest, I am making a note to read through the bookmarked blog posts I have not gotten around to (thank you to everyone who has shared). I want to dive into the backlog of personal blogs I have yet to catch up on. I always check out every Tavern commenter&rsquo;s website when they leave a URL in the form. I do not always get around to them immediately, but I have found many blogs that I genuinely enjoy reading this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heading into this year&rsquo;s U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, I am reminded of how fortunate I am to be a part of the WordPress community. It is a living, breathing ecosystem that has always remained true to its blogging roots. The platform allows millions of people to share their voices while owning their content.  That alone is something worth being thankful for.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:05:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 Revised Release Date Confirmed for January 25, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=126003\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-revised-release-date-confirmed-for-january-25-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4210:\"<p>Last week WordPress 5.9&rsquo;s release leads found a consensus for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-delayed-until-january-2022\">delaying the release</a> after missing the deadlines for Beta 1 due to significant blockers. At that time they proposed a schedule for moving forward, and that is now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-9/\">confirmed</a>. Beta 1 is planned for November 30, 2021, with subsequent betas in December. RC 1 is scheduled for January 4, 2022, and the official release is anticipated on January 25.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past decade, Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/04/20/deadlines-are-not-arbritrary-theyre-a/\">deadlines are not arbitrary</a> philosophy has guided core development, preventing  releases from being delayed by the desire to squeeze in one more feature:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Deadlines are not arbitrary, they&rsquo;re a promise we make to ourselves and our users that helps us rein in the endless possibilities of things that could be a part of every release. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Deadlines make it possible for agencies, product developers, and hosting companies with millions of WordPress customers, to prepare for upcoming releases in a predictable way that ultimately enables more sites to update regularly. The situation with WordPress 5.9 is unique, because the effort involves shipping a set of interdependent features that also provide the foundation for a new way of theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As the FSE features are very closely intertwined, removing some of its pieces would risk making the release unstable,&rdquo; 5.9 Core Tech Lead Tonya Mork said in a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/11/22/wordpress-5-9-revised-release-schedule/\">post</a> announcing the new schedule. &ldquo;To avoid delivering a sub-optimal experience, moving fixes to a 5.9 minor or 6.0 was ruled out.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mork said the team considered punting full-site editing (FSE) and the Twenty Twenty-Two theme that depends on it to 6.0 but saw more benefit in shipping the collection of features sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The 6.0 release isn&rsquo;t due until April 2022&mdash;too long for the community to wait for them,&rdquo; Mork said. &ldquo;After processing this<a href=\"http://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36556\">&nbsp;list of issues</a>,&nbsp;Core&nbsp;Editor team saw the features could ship in 5.9 with the revised schedule.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne McCarthy, who is co-leading testing for the release, is in the trenches with FSE and wrote a <a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2021/11/23/why-i-voted-to-delay-wordpress-5-9/\">summary</a> of why she was proponent of delaying in this instance. She cited improved sustainability for contributors, and the value of users getting access to the whole suite of FSE features rather than smaller pieces, as factors in the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;More specifically, if we were to push everything to 6.0, this would delay the Twenty Twenty-Two theme, hold back the launch of block themes in general, and delay a ton of user value in exploring ways to edit all parts of a site,&rdquo; McCarthy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to delay 5.9 to January 2022 has been met with positive feedback from all sides, and many following the progress have expressed their appreciation of the team&rsquo;s transparency throughout the decision-making process. It&rsquo;s reassuring to see the release leads acting in the interest of users and contributors, instead of forcing something half-baked forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, if you want a sneak peak of some newer features coming in 5.9, check out the video the release team <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/a-look-at-wordpress-5-9/\">published</a> today.

The company discovered unauthorized third-party access to its hosting environment on November 17, 2021, through an exploited vulnerability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy&rsquo;s initial investigations show the attacker gained access using a compromised password beginning on September 6, 2021. Nearly every sensitive data point associated with hosting a WordPress website was compromised, including customer email addresses, admin passwords, sFTP and database credentials, and SSL private keys. GoDaddy published the following summary of data the attacker had access to for more than two months:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Up to 1.2 million active and inactive Managed WordPress customers had their email address and customer number exposed. The exposure of email addresses presents risk of phishing attacks.</li><li>The original WordPress Admin password that was set at the time of provisioning was exposed. If those credentials were still in use, we reset those passwords.</li><li>For active customers, sFTP and database usernames and passwords were exposed. We reset both passwords.</li><li>For a subset of active customers, the SSL private key was exposed. We are in the process of issuing and installing new certificates for those customers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has more than 20 million customers but only the managed WordPress hosting accounts were affected by this breach. Looking further into the incident, <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/11/godaddy-breach-plaintext-passwords/\">Wordfence claims that GoDaddy was storing sFTP credentials as plaintext</a>, although GoDaddy has not officially confirmed it:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>GoDaddy stored sFTP passwords in such a way that the plaintext versions of the passwords could be retrieved, rather than storing salted hashes of these passwords, or providing public key authentication, which are both industry best practices.</p><p>We confirmed this by accessing the user interface for GoDaddy Managed Hosting and were able to view our own password&hellip;When using public-key authentication or salted hashes, it is not possible to view your own password like this because the hosting provider simply does not have it.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy&rsquo;s stock tumbled after the SEC disclosure got picked up by major news organizations, finishing down&nbsp;5.25%. The company <a href=\"http://previous%20incidents:%20https://twitter.com/lenraleigh/status/1462974068588789769\">emailed its customers</a> to notify them that their accounts may have been compromised during the two months when the attacker had unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The incident has damaged customers&rsquo; trust and puts developers and agencies in an uncomfortable position if they are required to notify their customers about the breach. Impacted site owners will need to watch for malware, suspicious activity, and potential phishing attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Godaddy says it has already taken steps to further secure its provisioning system and is continuing its investigation with the help of an IT forensics firm and law enforcement.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 04:55:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: How Do Post Formats Fit Into a Block Theme World?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125982\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:161:\"https://wptavern.com/how-do-post-formats-fit-into-a-block-theme-world?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-do-post-formats-fit-into-a-block-theme-world\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5899:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Over the weekend, Nick Bohle asked Ellen Bauer of Elma Studio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickbohle/status/1462231308697018373\">how post formats fit into the block-theming world</a>. The question was a proposal for her a WordPress theme and FSE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ZkJzbaDPVgJv/peek\">chat she held yesterday</a> via Twitter Spaces. I could not attend and see if Bauer touched on the subject, but the question is something I have given a lot of thought to not that long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the summer, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/1407208677795373056\">tweeted out a screenshot</a> of an experiment around post formats. A part of me was trying to figure out if we could revive a dying feature, one I continue to use today.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Aside post format archive.\n\n\n\n<p>I have been using post formats since before they were a thing. &ldquo;Asides&rdquo; were one of the precursors to the feature landing in WordPress. I wrote my first on my personal blog back in 2006. I had borrowed some code that WordPress cofounder Matt Mullenweg had <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2004/05/asides/\">posted two years earlier</a>. It was a concept he had borrowed from others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, it was a way to give a unique layout to quick posts and links without all the beefiness of a long-form article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, WordPress 3.1 launched with a new taxonomy. Users could choose between nine different formats for their posts, assuming their theme supported one or more of them. The goal was to allow theme authors to design custom layouts around each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For much of the community, it felt like WordPress was chasing Tumblr&rsquo;s post content feature. The allure quickly wore off after it seemed to have hit a standstill beyond its initial release. Besides a few fixes and trivial enhancements under the hood, post formats never amounted to much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have remained a niche feature over the years. A few theme authors still add in support. Some of us old-school bloggers who have been using them in some form or fashion are still hanging on. But, post formats have been dead for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I decided to try to make them work for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most frustrating things I encountered with post formats in this block-based theme project was how powerless I felt over making them work &ldquo;the old way.&rdquo; The dynamic nature of classic theming meant that I could switch post content templates out on pages that listed multiple posts. Query Loop and its inner Post Template block do not allow me to show a different template for a quote or gallery-formatted post, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was frustrating because that part of the design process was out of my hands. If I wanted to do something as simple as show an entirely different design for an aside post within a mix of normal posts, I could not do so as the theme designer, at least not without doing some hacky workarounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My &ldquo;light bulb&rdquo; moment was when I realized that it was OK to not have that control. I needed to get outside of the mindset that the design was mine and mine alone. That is viewing creation through a classic theming lens. My approach was wrong. Instead, I had to start thinking about how to hand over these design tools to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question became: Can I create something that utilizes that original post format concept while giving users the freedom to do what they want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, it dawned on me. The following is the response I tweeted to Jeff Chandler, who had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/1407211205685661700\">asked if I thought post formats</a> would work as patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I think of blocks themselves as an evolution of post formats. Video, audio, embeds (basically cool links), quotes, etc. Most of the elements are already there. Patterns just give users an easy way to insert various designs, which could build off those blocks.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe post formats as they currently exist are dead. However, the idea of designing a layout around specific types of posts is very much alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If users want to embed a single video into a post, it is just a matter of copying and pasting a link. To share a quote they found from their favorite author, they merely need to drop it into a Quote block. Other than chat posts (let&rsquo;s just gloss over those entirely), the concept of post formats has simply been replaced with blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, theme authors still have a role to play. If all the elements for post formats have been essentially replaced by blocks themselves, that means designers can have a field day building patterns around them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Patterns built for post formats.\n\n\n\n<p>That led me to build off my original idea for asides, my favorite post format. Instead of offering a single design, I built three different patterns for users to choose from. End-users could mix and match how they appeared on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also built a custom <code>taxonomy-post_format-aside.html</code> template to showcase them on their archive page. It merely displayed the published date and the post content, which the user controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went back to the drawing board and built a quote pattern that I liked. Again, it would be up to the user whether they wanted that particular design. They could always go in a different direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Quote block pattern and custom style.\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, post formats were always limiting. The feature was never fleshed out, and there were only nine allowed formats. At the end of the day, each was merely a term within a taxonomy. There were never any rules about how it all was supposed to work. Maybe that is not such a bad thing. Now, posts can be anything users want them to be.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 23:57:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WordPress.org blog: Join us for State of the Word 2021, in person or online!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11611\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/join-us-for-state-of-the-word-2021-in-person-or-online/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1704:\"<p>As <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">previously announced</a>, State of the Word will be livestreamed from New York City.

One afternoon, we walked Michigan Avenue, The Bean and the sculpture and botanical garden in Millennium Park. Another afternoon, we visited the Shedd Aquarium. It is definitely worth a visit should you ever get to Chicago. Their exhibition space is vast and wonderful.  My favorite section was the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWJxgUnAS7j/\">Caribbean Reef </a>with the most colorful corals, algae and fish.

The Automattic Theme Team had built a <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/create-blockbase-theme\">child theme creator</a> for its Blockbase WordPress parent theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/blockbase/\">Blockbase</a> has quickly started filling the role of Underscores, a starter that many developers used to create custom themes in the classic era. For block templating and global styles, something fresh was needed. It is both a launchpad and educational tool for theme authors who want to test the block theme waters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach is different now than in the past. Instead of using Blockbase as a customizable starting point, which is still a valid use case, the Automattic Theme Team is leaning far more heavily into child theming. It is a single parent to raise a legion of children, and the family has grown at a rapid pace. Since releasing Blockbase on WordPress.org, the team has already launched five child themes for it. Their <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/themes\">themes repo on GitHub</a> shows several others in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the talent in the team&rsquo;s arsenal and the Create Blockbase Theme plugin at hand, they could spit out design after design after design. Of course, the child themes might begin to lose some of their flavor if the team moved too fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dwyer created a custom theme called Typewriter, which is downloadable via the announcement post. For my test, I did not go quite as far with customization and relied on one of the pre-existing color schemes from Blockbase.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I primarily wanted to get a feel for how the tool worked. After a bit of tinkering, I had something that still felt much like its parent with some simple changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the plugin, users must install and activate the Blockbase theme. Until WordPress 5.9 is released, the Gutenberg plugin is necessary too. Currently, there are two places to make stylistic changes. The first is in the site editor. I made some adjustments to the header template part and index template. I also changed a few global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Customizing the index template and global styles.\n\n\n\n<p>The second place to modify the theme&rsquo;s design is via the customizer, which Blockbase enables (it is not accessible by default with block themes). The long-term goal should move all of these extra customizations to the site editor when it handles all the necessary use cases, such as a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\">web fonts API</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After switching the color scheme and selecting a couple of custom fonts, I had everything in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a custom font.\n\n\n\n<p>After I had all the customizations I wanted, I headed over to Appearance &gt; Create Blockbase Theme in the admin. The page has a handful of fields to fill in &mdash; just basic theme info. Once I was finished, clicking the &ldquo;Create Blockbase Theme&rdquo; created a downloadable ZIP file.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Generating a Blockbase child theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Everything worked. The only issue I ran into was with the theme folder slug when using a multi-word theme name. <code>Tavern Test</code> became <code>tavern_test.zip</code>. It is standard practice to hyphenate theme folders instead of using an underscore to separate multiple words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin does add a blank <code>screenshot.png</code> file. Creators will want to change that if they intend to publicly release their custom child theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the sort of future I have long imagined for the WordPress theme space, one that can empower anyone to create designs of their own. It is a future where an end-user, even a non-coder, can tinker around for a while, export whatever they have built, and share it with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not at that point with WordPress itself. The site editor currently allows users to export their templates. However, I hope that this same functionality is extended to exporting a fully-installable parent or child theme in the future. The basis of democratizing design means that everyone can give it a go without learning to code.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 23:42:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.9 Delayed Until January 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125857\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:145:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-delayed-until-january-2022?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-9-delayed-until-january-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6511:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://flickr.com/photos/bionicteaching/5948497535/in/photolist-a4DB5k-ddR7m6-2hY62pS-2j1SNKo-2gVgBDF-2iQKbJz-2mpRzg5-o5uNv-2kZXTrc-2kaA4cG-2ipXyyx-2i1FMBL-2hczLX3-2gVikgB-2kHAzjL-2gNm6zQ-4FqcGi-7GRAo8-2gNkmv2-2gNkms1-2m7Fjzj-2hy98BL-2iABt8S-2jcVFsu-R46BYR-atjfJF-cJjJXb-2jNysNx-2kRrhRt-RaqGFB-2hzjuNi-2hxXktV-2hzoRjj-2hy7SMX-2hYCngf-2g5DqMg-2eq7vbd-Fi1aN3-Q9DhTa-2hzp4eS-2hxJzsN-j1RYuM-RNKgg5-2kNMrwW-TAdgqb-rPgJLf-2cw8mMR-2gNm6Dc-2j4c5D2-2hdmx5p\">Tom Woodward</a>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/11/17/wordpress-5-9-beta-1-delayed/\">WordPress 5.9 has been delayed</a> due to significant blockers that could not be resolved in time for Beta 1, which was previously <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/03/wordpress-5-9-planning-roundup/\">scheduled</a> to be released November 16. The 5.9 release team came to the decision after a lengthy deliberation on the impact a delay will have on users and contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert Anderson, Editor Tech Lead for 5.9, published <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36556\">a summary of the blockers</a> that were found while testing full-site editing in&nbsp;core&nbsp;this week. They are identified as either blockers for beta 1 or blockers for 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Historically (and even in the linked post), &lsquo;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/04/20/deadlines-are-not-arbritrary-theyre-a/\">deadlines are not arbitrary</a>&lsquo; has referred to the ability to cut features that aren&rsquo;t quite ready yet, and include them in a future release,&rdquo; Gary Pendergast commented on the post announcing 5.9 beta 1 as delayed. &ldquo;Are there particular reasons for why this philosophy has been re-interpreted?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya Mork, Core Tech Lead for the 5.9 release, responded with an explanation that FSE is going to have to be a package deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Removing those areas that need fixing were ruled out as they are too intertwined into FSE and would make it unstable,&rdquo; Mork said. &ldquo;Punting fixes was ruled out as these meant delivering a &lsquo;half-baked&rsquo; experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The choice is between shipping these major features in 5.9 with a delay or moving these major features to 6.0 to ship in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Impacts were assessed. Shipping these major features sooner than later were determined to be more beneficial with less impact.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others commenting on the post shared concerns about the features possibly being rushed after seeing the list of blockers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My initial reaction when reading the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36556\">Overview of WP 5.9 pending issues and blockers</a>&nbsp;-issue on&nbsp;Gutenberg&nbsp;repository was &lsquo;holy smokes, there are so many open issues and blockers,\'&rdquo; Timi Wahalahti said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of a developer working in an agency and having 150+ client sites to look after, I do have similar concerns that Gary and Addison (in the Gutenberg repo issue) have already shared about rushing features out. After seeing the&nbsp;blocker&nbsp;list and reading how new major features are still under works, I&rsquo;d be very uncomfortable on updating to 5.9 after releasing it, knowing that some features were probably finished in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors on GitHub cautioned that the new flows for FSE features have not been adequately tested and should not be shipped just days after landing major changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think there are some large red flags here that some things are not ready for 5.9,&rdquo; Gutenberg contributor Addison Stavlo said. &ldquo;Overall, it seems like right now we are rushing things in a dangerous way. We targeted 5.9 as the release for these items in core but too many things are just not ready, hence the rushing to change so many things at the last minute. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to miss the expected target date than to rush potentially regrettable decisions and brand new flows into core WP at the last minute?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new proposed schedule, which has not yet been officially confirmed, is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nov 30 &ndash; Beta 1 (2 weeks from now)</li><li>Dec 7 &ndash; Beta 2</li><li>Dec 14 &ndash; Beta 3</li><li>Dec 21 &ndash; Beta 4 (optional)</li><li>Jan 4 &ndash; RC 1 (5 weeks from Beta)</li><li>Jan 11 &ndash; RC2</li><li>Jan 18 &ndash; RC 3</li><li>Jan 25 &ndash; Release date</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of publishing, all 18 contributors who weighed in on <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02JUSF02TT/p1637262875087500\">a poll in the 5.9 release leads slack channel</a> are in favor of the proposed new schedule. More blockers are being resolved and should continue throughout the weekend, but the delay to Beta 1 makes it inevitable that the stable release will be pushed back to January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remaining consideration is whether or not FSE will be on track for inclusion in 5.9 or if it will need to be shipped in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If for some reason progress does not advance on track or something unknown / unexpected happens to cause further delays, then FSE features and TT2 theme are at risk to be punted to 6.0,&rdquo; Mork told the Tavern. The team is working to put safeguards in place to protect the release from further delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;FSE is a collection of features with some that are interconnected,&rdquo; WordPress 5.9 Testing Co-Lead Anne McCarthy said. &ldquo;This release includes a selection that are interconnected including Styles, Block theme flows, Navigation Block, etc. In order for them to really shine, it makes the most sense for them to be released together, making it hard to just delay shipping one. They need more time to be refined in order to be shipped&nbsp;<em>together</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release team plans to publish an update on Monday with confirmation of the schedule moving forward. McCarthy noted that contributions have been lower this year, which has contributed to the delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to recognize the very Human situation we&rsquo;re in right now both in terms of larger cultural moments coming up with various holidays/celebrations and the reality of still being in the midst of a pandemic,&rdquo; McCarthy said. &ldquo;Delaying provides sustainability to get this release right without potentially burning out the remaining contributor base.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 23:07:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 10.0.0 Beta 1 Delayed, Stable Release Rescheduled for December 24\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-10-0-0-beta-1-delayed-stable-release-rescheduled-for-december-24?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-10-0-0-beta-1-delayed-stable-release-rescheduled-for-december-24\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2662:\"<p>The upcoming BuddyPress 10.0.0 beta 1 release was scheduled for November 20, but contributors have decided to <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2021/11/18/bp-dev-chat-summary-november-17-2021/\">postpone the beta</a> by two weeks, due to lack of time for adequately testing recent improvements to the planned features.

Improvements to site membership requests are still under review and need more testing, which was one factor in the decision to postpone beta 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are also still working on <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8581\">extending no content activities with images and call of actions</a>, a feature that needs some refinement to the initial approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unrelated to the postponed beta schedule, BuddyPress contributors are now discussing a proposal regarding the core BP blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was thinking we should probably stop adding blocks to BP Core and instead create standalone blocks into the WordPress plugins directory,&rdquo; BuddyPress core developer Mathieu Viet said during the most recent dev chat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One advantage of not packaging them with BuddyPress is that they can be updated independently of core updates, which happen less frequently. One contributor, Varun Dubey, noted that this will increase the number of active plugins on sites and suggested the team consider bundling them in a block collection plugin instead. Anyone with a strong opinion on the matter is encouraged to share it as a comment on the most recent <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2021/11/18/bp-dev-chat-summary-november-17-2021/\">BP Dev Chat summary post</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 05:03:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Post Status: The Open Web Manifesto\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://poststatus.com/?post_type=mn_rocks_news&p=89816\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://poststatus.com/news/the-open-web-manifesto/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:693:\"<p>Accessibility, Creatibility, and Connectibility — these are the three things that define the Open Web in its ideal state.

What started as a joke to crown his WP Builds podcast as the best quickly took a positive turn that has seen several charitable donations in the past week or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The awards &ldquo;contest&rdquo; is simple. Anyone can donate the minimum amount of $10 to <a href=\"https://www.bigorangeheart.org/\">Big Orange Heart</a> and show their receipt via the submission form.  They can then create a new award category for the <a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/wp-builds-wordpress-awards-2021/\">WP Builds awards page</a> and claim themselves as the sole winner. There are 27 days remaining to enter.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Awards page and submission form.\n\n\n\n<p>While I certainly want to be charitable, I saw this as an opportunity to crown myself as the Best WordPress Halo Player in 2021. I have already won, so no one can dispute it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all seriousness, Big Orange Heart is a worthy cause in which to donate, regardless of whether you claim your award. The charity organization focuses on mental and physical health for remote workers. It offers coaching, mentoring, workshops, and other resources to over 14,500 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So I really did not come up with this,&rdquo; said Wrigley. &ldquo;It was an accident. I saw a few posts about a variety of awards polls (both inside WordPress and outside too), and I thought that it would be funny to create an Awards poll of my own. It had only one question, which was &lsquo;Best Podcast called WP Builds&rsquo; and there was only one option to choose from, which was, <em>erm</em>&hellip;WP Builds. I thought that this was enormously funny because somewhat humorless dad jokes are the level that I&rsquo;m on.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpbuilds/status/1458387183283458056\">posted on Twitter</a> and got 30 votes for the joke award poll in which his podcast could be the only winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;A day later, I got a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1458431706243997702\">tweet from Jamie Marsland</a> of PootlePress who said (jokingly, I expect) that he&rsquo;d give me &pound;10 if I would add a new question of &lsquo;Best WordPress Tennis Player&rsquo; and him as the only possible winner. Now, I know nothing about tennis (or WordPress, if the truth be known), and so I thought about this for a moment. I imagined all of the things that I would do with Jamie&rsquo;s &pound;10. The new Bond film at the cinema, some new tennis balls, a billionth of a Bitcoin&hellip;Then I remembered Big Orange Heart.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, a new fundraiser and faux awards contest had been born. Wrigley described Big Orange Heart as a charity that&rsquo;s really close to his heart. He told Marsland <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpbuilds/status/1458432722955902977\">to donate to the organization</a> to earn his spot. A $25 contribution and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1458433464559091713\">screenshot of a receipt</a> later, and he had become the unofficial best WordPress tennis player.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be outdone, Nigel M Rodgers later won the &ldquo;Bestest Best WordPress Tennis Player&rdquo; award. It is all in good fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So this silliness had taken a new turn,&rdquo; said Wrigley. &rdquo; A silly idea had generated $25 for Big Orange Heart. My heart was racing; this could be huge. I went to bed. In the morning, I woke up and sent out a new tweet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If you donate $10 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aBigOrangeHeart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@aBigOrangeHeart</a> I will make you a 100% certain winner of a category of your choosing in \"The WP Builds WordPress Awards 2021\".

Now that we are just ahead of the holidays, it is always a welcome time to donate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle Frechette &ldquo;is actually triplets masquerading as one person&rdquo; reads one award. Leanne Mitton is the &ldquo;Best Gnome Collector in the WordPress community.&rdquo; Isaac Coleman is &ldquo;The Most Awesome 13 Year Old in the World&rdquo; &mdash; <em>there could be a proud parent involved in that one</em>. And, there are many others to read through just for laughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrigley does not yet know if he will run it in 2022. He is waiting to see how this one turns out. With enough support from the WordPress community, it could be fun to keep up with every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, Big Orange Heart is the only accepted charitable organization. However, I asked if Wrigley would be open to others in our space in the future, assuming he keeps it up next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that there would be ways to allow the person making the donation to choose alternative charities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This seems like a great idea! I&rsquo;m open to suggestions about which charities we could include.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong><em>Nathan Wrigley runs the WP Jukebox podcast for WP Tavern.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 19:12:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Post Status: Post Status Excerpt (No. 33) — The Next Chapter For In-Person WordCamps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=89029\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://poststatus.com/excerpt/33/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3940:\"<h2>&#8220;I expect the hallway track to be pretty busy during this event.&#8221; —Nathan Ingram</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, David talks with special guests <strong>Nathan Ingram</strong> and <strong>Ryan Marks</strong> about <strong>WordCamp Birmingham 2022</strong> — one of the first in-person WordCamps after almost two years of no live events anywhere in the world.

Google-sponsored WordPress core committer Felix Arntz opened <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53675\">a ticket to improve lazy loading</a>, which will be included in WordPress 5.9. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WebP adoption in WordPress has been growing since the 5.8 release, however users need to manually convert their images to WebP before uploading to take advantage of the format,&rdquo; Silverstein said. &ldquo;Landing WebP as the default format for sub-sized images which was started in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52867\">this ticket</a>&nbsp;will have a much bigger impact by automatically converting uploaded images to WebP.&#8203;&#8203;&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few highlights of Silverstein&rsquo;s observations from the analysis include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>70% of origins are on the latest version of WordPress and 88% are on one of the last two versions, meaning changes we make to core reach the majority of sites relatively quickly.</li><li>The number of origins is quite low for older versions of WordPress, with fewer than 5k origins for most versions before 4.7</li><li>Overall CWV pass rates have generally decreased over WordPress versions. Although it might also be the case that &ldquo;leading-edge&rdquo; websites that update to the latest version are generally slower than those that linger on older versions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein anticipates this analysis will provide the basis for tracking major improvements in the future. The Google-sponsored WordPress contributors on his team are active in certain core projects and are leading <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team\">WordPress&rsquo; new performance team</a> with the goal of improving core performance as measured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Google&rsquo;s Core Web Vitals</a>&nbsp;metrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Basically I wanted to create a way to measure the impact of core WordPress improvements on WordPress sites (at scale),&rdquo; Silverstein told the Tavern. &ldquo;My team at Google is focused on helping improve the performance of the web at scale, and WordPress is a huge part of that! You may have noticed us working on features like lazy loaded images and iframes, WebP image support and now helping start the performance group. I wanted to find a way to see if our work is having a measurable impact &ndash; and not just on a vanilla WordPress site you might set up for testing, but in the wild, or real world websites that upgrade to the latest version of WordPress. That is the goal of the dashboard.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ab251873-b787-4a8e-b4c8-efccf4b9a911/page/HUaeC?s=vvFHFeV3n_Q\">dashboard</a>, which tracks WordPress CWV performance by version, is available to the performance team for monitoring their progress with each new WordPress release. Google-sponsored contributors are using it to measure the impact of their efforts across various performance initiatives.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 03:15:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: Rank Math SEO Launches a Content AI Feature\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125464\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:151:\"https://wptavern.com/rank-math-seo-launches-a-content-ai-feature?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rank-math-seo-launches-a-content-ai-feature\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8496:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Last week, the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/\">Rank Math SEO</a> plugin received a major update that includes a new artificial intelligence system. The Content AI feature is a SaaS product that behaves like a personal writing assistant to boost search rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We built Rank Math&rsquo;s Content AI feature to revolutionize the content production and optimization process with proprietary AI that gives SEOs and content marketers a competitive edge,&rdquo; said Bhanu Ahluwalia, Rank Math&rsquo;s CMO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system allows users to research what their content should look like based on a keyword. Each keyword analysis costs one credit. This data is stored on the user&rsquo;s server, so the same keyword used on multiple posts does not cost extra. Users get five free credits after signing up for a user account with Rank Math. However, they must upgrade to one of the three commercial plans, ranging from $59 to $499 per year, for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the <a href=\"https://rankmath.com/offer/\">commercial plans</a> comes with a specific number of credits. They are marketed as free extras, but they are not &ldquo;free&rdquo; for users who want to upgrade for credits alone. The team says they are working on a pricing solution to address this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should see a new Content AI module that they can enable from the plugin&rsquo;s Dashboard screen. Turning this on creates a new tab under the plugin&rsquo;s General Settings page for further configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Content AI general settings.\n\n\n\n<p>The Content AI feature works with the WordPress editor, the classic editor, Elementor, and Divi. However, the team plans to extend this support to other page builders in the future</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can then enter a focus keyword from the post-editing screen and click the Content AI button. From there, they can research their chosen keyword, and Rank Math pulls up suggestions from their system.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Example post with Content AI score.\n\n\n\n<p>The scoring system is easy to understand. Above 80 (in the green) is considered &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Anything below might need some work based on the plugin&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary suggestions from the Content AI center on total words, links, headings, and media. When asked how the numbers were figured, Ahluwalia said, &ldquo;This is a computation performed based on the top-ranking content in search engine results pages (i.e., characteristics of content that ranks).&rdquo; It is a proprietary system, so maybe the team is not ready to give away the exact details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature also lets users copy related keywords to use in their posts, offers questions that the content should answer, and lists potential links to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following video explains how Content AI works:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"are-content-scores-a-good-thing\">Are Content Scores a Good Thing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I am admittedly skeptical of any claims from SEO tools. There is value in most of the plugins in the space, and Rank Math is no different. However, I also want end-users to take SEO or content scores with a grain of salt. Hitting a specific word, link, heading, or media count is not going to make or break you. These should be guidelines, not goalposts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked how the score was calculated, I was pointed to a <a href=\"https://rankmath.com/kb/seo-score-vs-content-ai-score/\">knowledgebase article</a> on the Rank Math website. Nothing in the Content AI section explicitly explains the &ldquo;math&rdquo; behind the score. Essentially, the documentation references how the AI analyzes search results for various factors and describes how the tool works. There is some generally solid advice throughout, but it does not answer how those scores are calculated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular area of concern was the recommended media count for each post. I had access to a full demo of the feature with a few dozen posts to check. Nearly all that I ran through the Content AI had a recommendation of using 18 media. The number felt off. While I cannot claim to be an SEO guru, I do not see why a typical 1,000 or 2,000-word post should need that many images or videos. Even with web-optimized media, that could bring page-loading speed to a crawl for many site visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That entirely depends on the focus keyword that you had set for your post,&rdquo; said Ahluwalia on how the recommended count is determined. &ldquo;Page speed is a ranking factor, but the media count and its associated guideline there is a super simple way to quickly see and consider whether that&rsquo;s something that you need to do to rank as well. If we&rsquo;re, for example, looking at the keyword &lsquo;SEO tools,&rsquo; the recommendation is as high as 26, which is unsurprising because the majority of ranking content hasn&rsquo;t just covered essential SEO tools, they&rsquo;ve covered the 15, 20, or even 109 &lsquo;best SEO tools.&rsquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This concern with using media in content as it relates to page speed is surprisingly common, but the reality is that content without design doesn&rsquo;t typically perform particularly well (even if it ends up ranking, then not from a conversion/social sharing perspective because people leave with the impression of encountering a wall of text). A lot of the content on our site wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without the images in the posts to paint the full picture and distill what are complex SEO processes/ideas into something that&rsquo;s super simple for people to understand.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I generally agree that sites should use media alongside text. Looking over one of the demo posts I had access to, the content did not seem to warrant the recommended count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular post had 1,199 words and 32 paragraphs. It also had six images, which presumably played a significant role in the 20/100 score. Content AI recommended 18 instances of media.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Had the post met the recommended media count, there would have been one image for at least every two paragraphs. Even with half that number, visitors would unlikely think they are just &ldquo;encountering a wall of text.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the analysis is correct. Perhaps it will help sites rank. But, that much media mixed in with text strikes me as a sub-optimal reading experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary concern with tools like Content AI &mdash; this applies to SEO plugins in general &mdash; is that site owners are trying to make sure they are <em>in the green</em>. Instead of writing for readers, they are writing to rank. The two things are not mutually exclusive, but when end-users take recommendations as gospel, it can lead to stunted prose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We completely agree, and while AI content has come a long way, we&rsquo;re very much also still fans of well-researched content that&rsquo;s put together by humans like you and I (as is all of the content on our own blog),&rdquo; said Ahluwalia. &ldquo;The goal with Rank Math&rsquo;s Content AI is assisted content production and optimization (streamlined by software).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Broadly speaking, as you say, traffic-light style scores or numerical scores don&rsquo;t paint a full picture for most content. This was a very big motivation for the new content optimization suggestions that go beyond typical scoring (that is the same no matter what you&rsquo;re writing about). When writing something that isn&rsquo;t search-driven at all (i.e. targeting a keyword and search intent that has little demand and no competition with a thought leadership piece, for example) you&rsquo;re not writing for searchers, you&rsquo;re writing for a specific set of people you have in mind. This content is still incredibly valuable though.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He went on to say that for what the Rank Math team calls &ldquo;search-driven&rdquo; content, there are specific elements that well-ranking competing content has in common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It goes without saying that when using content optimization tools the consideration for still writing good content that&rsquo;s helpful has to be there for the end result to be truly exceptional,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With the aim here being to aid the creation of content, ensuring it addresses search intent, and meets what search engines deem valuable and useful content.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Nov 2021 01:11:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #55 – Gutenberg 11.9, WordPress 5.9, Navigation Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=19591\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-55-gutenberg-11-9-wordpress-5-9-navigation-block/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56225:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack, Grzegorz Ziolkowski discuss Gutenberg 11.9, WordPress 5.9 and Navigation Block.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 11.9, WordPress 5.9 coming up to a WordPress instance near you and then about navigation area block on Full-Site Editing and all the good things that come to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator of the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And today, I have two co-hosts. You all know Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and WordPress core contributor. And our surprise guest today is Riad Benguella, one of the lead developers on Gutenberg and also code wrangler at Automattic. I am delighted you are here with us Riad, thanks for joining us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hi, Birgit. Thanks for having me. It&#8217;s an honor for me to join you and Grzegorz on the show, and help spread the Gutenberg love to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s good. Yeah. Well, your passion for it is really contagious when I saw you before at WordCamp US and so when we met, it&#8217;s always nice and yeah patiently explaining things to me. So are you both on a team retreat? Where are you right now in the world and how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Hola, qué tal? That means greetings from Spain. So I&#8217;m so happy that Riad joins us today to discuss the latest 11.9 Gutenberg plugin release and the upcoming COR press 5.9 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s so great to be able to meet colleagues again, we are kind of learning to travel again. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, I&#8217;m also, so looking forward to be able to join the community in upcoming word camps in-person events. We miss these a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The one is happening in Seville in December. That&#8217;s going to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You&#8217;re going to be there in December in Seville.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m not it&#8217;s the connection to Seville is bad for me, but I know that some of my colleagues from Spain, which will be there from Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riad Benguella: Personally I&#8217;m so looking forward to word camp Europe in Porto in June, hopefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, me too. Me too. And I&#8217;m so excited. I was excited two years ago when it was supposed to happen and now I&#8217;m even more excited to come to Portugal and to see everybody from Europe again, it&#8217;s going to be such a great event. And I hope that all the people that are still hesitant about vaccinations, that they get their shots, also the booster shots so we can all be together. Because I found that in-person meetings are so much richer than even though an online meeting like this, it&#8217;s good to help out and kind of bridge the gap. But the in-person meeting, even with family, we visited the family for five weeks in August and September. And there was such a relief to finally be together in one room again, and just hang out and go out and eat and just sit and chat. Yeah. But back to here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"announcements-1\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just wanted to let you know that November 22 is a WordPress meetup in Montclair, New Jersey, which is a virtual meetup and anybody can join. And I will demo the concept of full-site editing. And I will also take questions, AMA style, ask me anything style and it will take place on 7:00 PM eastern 12:00 AM. I was just going to think, is this am or PM because, it&#8217;s 12:00 AM UTC. And if you go to meetup.com, look for WordPress Montclair in New Jersey to sign up for it. Well, of course we will have the link in the show notes but it would be great if you want to learn more about what&#8217;s coming to WordPress 5.9 and Full Site editing to join us there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And speaking of that, I would like to thank props to Munir Kamal for reminding us on Twitter about the new tag that is in the WordPress teams directory, which called Full-Site editing. And it allows you to see all the block teams that are already there and it looks that we have 27 teams that are marked with this tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. That&#8217;s great that, tweeting that out Munir. I&#8217;m also seeing that&#8217;s also a link that I will share in the show notes, of course, and also in the meeting at Montclair and some of the themes that are in there are actually universal themes. They work for a classic theme or a block theme. So it&#8217;s quite interesting to see how you can switch it over. But don&#8217;t use them on production caveat it&#8217;s still a beta kind of feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s like in one month, everything could change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Everything, the whole Internet&#8217;s going to change. But only if you want it. Yeah, we don&#8217;t want to scare anybody to upgrade to 5.9 because it&#8217;s all opt in. And it&#8217;s only when you have a block theme available, the Full-Site Editing is actually available to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-released-wordpress-5-8-2-and-gutenberg-11-9\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 5.8.2 and Gutenberg 11.9&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released in last week, we had the WordPress 5.8.2 release, that&#8217;s a maintenance and security fix. And if you haven&#8217;t updated yet, you definitely should do so now. Most WordPress managed hostings automatically update to a point release, but not everybody is comfortable doing that, but update it. And the other release was of course the Gutenberg 11.9 plugin release with 223 PRs, yes I counted them and they made it into the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The largest ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: I also counted the PRs for WordPress 5.9, and it&#8217;s actually 600 feature PRs and like 400 bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: So it&#8217;s like 1000 PRs that are coming to WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Whoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: In a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s huge. Yeah. So the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: I don&#8217;t know how the community managed to do that, but yeah. It&#8217;s very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Well, thank you for the data. So 600 features and 400 bug fixes. That&#8217;s a thousand, wow. Yeah and how many contributors, you don&#8217;t know, but we will know in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s important. Someone will run the script that will calculate everything for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Stay tuned. Right. Okay. So what&#8217;s in Gutenberg 11.9.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"enhancements\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> So first we start with new blocks, but they are not part of WordPress 5.9&#8217;s release. They are still experimental and they are related to comments block, we already have one that is going to be in 5.9, this which is called post comments and is basically everything you see when you go to the comments section under the post. And this one is something brand new. So we are doing it in a way that is more granular and similar to the way how the query loop block works. So the new blocks are comment replying, comment edit link, comment outer avatar, and the comments query loop. There is also comment templates. So the idea is you can combine everything, decide what you want to display and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: I was going to mention the navigation block and the work that has been performed during this release, which is an important work that was actually answering some feedback from the user testing that happened on FSE. So users were finding it a bit hard to actually reuse navigation across teams and across templates for FSE teams. So an important work went into the navigation block during this release. So now the blocks are actually saved into their own custom post type. They work like template parts so you should be able to reuse navigation menus more easily across templates, and when you switch teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also the same features will allow classic themes to migrate more seamlessly into a block theme. So when you switch from a classic theme to a block theme, all your navigation should probably be retained. And yeah, these are some important change that are coming and actually was important before the beta of WordPress 5.9, which is I think coming tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. It needed to be within the feature freeze. So it makes it in 5.9 and bug fixes will come probably with the next plugin release that will be back porting some of the issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you for mentioning the navigation block I have, in the last few days before I went to Chicago, tested some of the navigation items, and I&#8217;m glad that some made it in there. One is the single placeholder for the block. Where you can actually select the menu when you already have one or add all the pages or start an empty navigation block. And that is really helpful for users to get it all set up. But I also like, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s in the release note now, but what also helps is that you can add the site title to the navigation or a site logo to the navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s all kind of one unit that is on the header. That definitely spruces up the FSE, as Riad mentioned, FSE means Full-Site Editing and listeners will know, that referred to the Full Site Editing outreach program, that is run by Anne McCarthy. Do we have anything else? Oh, what I also like is the responsive navigation, there is a way to get the hamburger menu out of the box with a little feature there. And you can decide if you want the hamburger menu by default, also for your desktop site or just for the mobile site. And another tool is there that you can have the menu, have a navigation, an orientation horizontal or vertical. So you could if you wanted to put it in a column block on the left hand side, and it kind of goes down the left hand side, like one of the default themes, I think it was 15 that had a navigation block on the left hand side, yeah. All right and then we had these post comments, but it was interesting to hear that will not come into 5.9. Thanks for pointing that out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There, are two things it&#8217;s quite confusing because we had a post comments like plural, a post comment, but also post comment, singular block. So the, the one that has that got deprecated was the more or less what we are trying to replicate now with comment template block. But the old one, it was just very limited. And it worked more like a format you had to provide a comment ID, which was very hard to use for you. You don&#8217;t know the comment ID of your comments. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I don&#8217;t even know the post ID. Yeah. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Otherwise there was enhancement to the post comments blocks that will be included also in Twenty Twenty-Two default theme. And there was some features missing, there was some issues with the marking inside the block, and also in some cases is when the outer of the site decides to close the comments. So we should show proper messaging or you can also on your website decide that after a certain amount of time, you can no longer comment on posts anymore. So these cases are sorted it out and it should work pretty good in those situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I also see that the post comment form that&#8217;s now available for block based theme on the post template, I would think. Yeah. Excellent. Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were some enhancements for accessibility with announcing the formatting change to screen readers also communicate to the screen reader the post title is a text area and some other smaller fixes or enhancements there, which is in all the little things that kind of make a user experience so much richer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the block editor we have the enable rich previews in the link UI for the site editor. That is something that had been in the block editor for, I think two versions of the plugin and now it also comes to the site editor. That&#8217;s a feature that when you put a link text in a paragraph or in a navigation or wherever you need it and you save it and then come back to it, you come back to update the post or you just kind of continue editing it, and you hover over the link, you get a rich preview with a title, a description as well as if it&#8217;s available, a feature image. So, you know exactly if the link is still working or if you need to update it in your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah. As we get closer to 5.9 the contributors worked more on parity between site editor and post editor. So they brought these features, the link preview, the save keyboard. Now you can press command S and it triggers the saving. And there were some discussions also about the menu item of site editor and where we place it exactly and where it makes most sense. So for the moment, this decision has been to use editor and move it in their appearance. And it&#8217;s now worked that way across WordPress trunk. And also the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Now the controversy is that under appearance, we have editor and a theme editor, so that&#8217;s a confusing thing that probably needs to be further discussed among the contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I hear you there. There is a lot of editing going on. Yeah. And the theme editor it&#8217;s really hazard because it gets you to the files of your PHP theme. And if you change a code and leave a quote out or something like that, you can actually create fatal error messages on your site. And it&#8217;s very hard to get to them to fix it. So I would always suggest to take away the theme editor instead of the site editor, because the site editor is a much safer place to be for someone who is not particularly technical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Makes me wonder if it&#8217;s basically the ancestor of the site editor. In classic themes, you cannot edit the theme directly, you have to edit the code. So you go to the theme editor, or you edit the files manually. So now that you have the site editor, maybe we could consider removing the theme editor&#8217;s UI entirely. I don&#8217;t know if it makes sense anymore to have it there. Maybe some people still would still need it from time to time, but is it something that the user should be exposed then by default? That&#8217;s I think a question that could be discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah I think so. You&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Could be left somewhere, but probably you need to know what to do and finding in one place or when you know the link. And the other things that maybe the only reason why we should keep that exposed is for the CSS code. Maybe at this time, when not everything is covert with global styles. There are some reasons for people to use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a similar case with the customizer. Yeah. When you have a Full Site Editing theme, a block by theme, the customizer itself, link in the appearance menu disappears, but the customizer is still available through the theme card on the theme screen. So you could still use the customizer if there&#8217;s something in there that a plugin put in there that the theme doesn&#8217;t have a control yet for it. And that could be a similar way to do, okay a Full-Site Editing theme is a block theme, is active. Yeah. Let&#8217;s remove the theme editor for that part and see what happens and just let the functionality be in there, but not have it in the menu. I think that will be valid to have that discussion. Yes. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and then the next one of Full-Site Editing Enhancement is the Search. Control Component that you can have inside the navigation menu. I really like that. It could use a few more controls to adjust the size of it a bit in relation to the other items in the navigation menu. But that is certainly fixable in a later version, but just having it there, it really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. This navigation block becomes so powerful, there are so many options. And I really like how it evolves over time also, how it becomes easier to use with every release. It came a really long way from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: And the challenge always with these powerful features is to find the balance between the good user experience, and also continue adding features without deteriorating the simplicity of the block. So, yeah I think we will continue to iterate on these things until we find the right balance there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think the other balance is also to strike, what do we want as feature parity to the previous version or the previous way of doing menus? Because there were quite a few extenders who extended the menu controls through plugins and themes and all that. I&#8217;m not sure that they all have been tested and kind of migrated over. I think there&#8217;s still some experience and some learning to be done, but is there a way to do it differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Well, and then we have duo tone component there was only one change in the description that the underlying image that is to which the duo tone is applied is not changed. I think that&#8217;s a very important distinction because people always fear that something changes that they don&#8217;t have any control over and there was something else in duo tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah. The duo tone now is using transparency as well. So you could have a background and a duo tone and transparency and have the background shine through. So it&#8217;s multiple layers of features that you can put on top of it, and I will share in the show notes, a video that Anne McCarthy did to kind of show you how this all works together. And she has some very neat representation of some of her photos now with the different duo tones there. Yeah, you have to see it to actually appreciate it really and not get confused about things, but I really love it. Duo tone. It&#8217;s almost like gradients and I love gradients. You could do now gradients in duo tone with transparency, background on cover. So yeah, what else can you need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: There&#8217;s so many customization control now available on the plugin and the contributors keep adding more and more. And I think it&#8217;s an infinite work. You can open your imagination and just make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Riad in 10 years we will still talk about gradients and where we can apply it. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And there is now also a change to the tools panel, which is related mostly to the setting sidebar. So the thing that change is the type of section. So in the past, you would have a list of controls displayed at once. Now, you have better control over what&#8217;s displayed by default and you can enable more controls or hide some of them when you stop using them. It&#8217;s very similar to the dimension panel. That&#8217;s already in the plugin for quite a while. And the direction is just to give the same capabilities to all sections. So they work the same way. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: This change also use a, a little bit that you can actually have multiple columns in the theme, in the typography controls, when they&#8217;re just small controls, you get two next to each other, and that certainly saves you some real estate or some spool on up and down on that. And, and I like it. It has a more harmonious layout there. So like that. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: The idea with these tools panels is that we should unify how blocks show their different customization option on the sidebar. So typography uses the tools panel color U could use the tools panel. I think there is another one dimensions could use the tools panel. So that way, no matter the block you are using, you could SU similar things on the, on this side. And if you find it too overwhelming, you could show and hide the controls you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s awesome. Yeah. Yeah. It kind of goes a little bit towards what, what we have been discussing on the developer advocacy relations team that can we have some best practices on yeah. If somebody builds a custom block yeah. Best practices on how to distinguish between the side settings and the toolbar settings and all that. I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s time to kind of put some of those best practices in writing. So of people can look it up and I will going to work that&#8217;s part of our 2022 kind of plan to figure that out and work with the developers on that. So consistency goes a long way in not having to figure out this for every single block or for every single type of block. How is a car applied cred and applied and all that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: In this case, we are following what Riad did for the block toolbar. So he created groups like for block, for formatting controls and so on. And here we will have also those extension points for dimension colors, typographic easy. You know, it&#8217;s not still setting stone, how it&#8217;ll end up. So we don&#8217;t want to spoil the game and like introduce any hustle to the community. But once everything is ready, then we&#8217;ll definitely come up with some recommendations that we share with the community. Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the template editor has as a template part focus mode. Now that means that you can separately change the header or the footer in your site editor. There&#8217;s also a post available on the make blog/core about those editor improvements and the template part focus mode that you now can use to, when you look in the site editor, you have always the full page, but if you just want to isolate the header and just look at that, you can switch over to the template part focus mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: The next thing is, if you are building a theme, whether it&#8217;s classic or block theme and using theme JSON, there is a small change that you could apply to your theme JSON. So for consistency, we removed some custom prefixes from some settings like custom line height, custom margin and custom filing, I think. So you could move to theme JSON version two and remove these prefixes that way you&#8217;re on the last version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So to do that, you need in your team, JSON, at a new field called, version. Oh, it&#8217;s not in new field, but you need to set version to number two. And that basically enables this new updated APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I know that there were quite a few efforts around the development team to put actually a schema up on schema store and have also the link via.webpress.org. And are those schema already updated to the version two? Do we know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh, thank you for reminding about that yet. It&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s ready for both block JSON and theme JSON it&#8217;s now in WordPress domain and the new member, the URL, we will show that later in the show notes. And yes, it&#8217;s already the old one that you could use will still work because the schema in the schema store it has a very interesting configuration. So it&#8217;s now referencing the new URL, so whatever use it will work anyway. And as we found out, someone pointed that out, I don&#8217;t remember but anyway, even if you don&#8217;t provide the dollar schema field, most of the editors will be able to recognize that based on the name of the file and they will show you hints anyway. So you only need probably to do that for visual studio code explicitly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm. Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting to know there&#8217;s some learning to be on the editor. So, oh you use it once I know where that was. See here. Yeah, I excellent. Speaking of gradients, now you can show all the colors on the gradient origin in the different panels. So there&#8217;s a new panel when you do site editing and color configuration, and it has the core color palette, the themed color palette. And if a user creates their own color palette, it will show there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a little bit crowded and I know there&#8217;s also an issue posted to find a way to actually remove the core color palette because it has so many colors and when people use it some team developers or agencies definitely would want to remove that. But it&#8217;s a nicer interface, but it has the text color 1, 2, 3 core theme and user. And then it has the background color in core theme and user colors. And then it has the link colors as well. If it, theme JSON says, please use the link color scheme as well, and then it will go in there as well. And it&#8217;s interesting to see. So I&#8217;m looking forward to the user feedback that we are going to get there to adjust an next iteration now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: So one of the original reasons for this feature, why do we introduce these different pallets core theme and user is, if you think about patterns, we have now a directory for patterns and theme could provide patterns and we wanted to have some color in these patterns, right? And so how can we make sure that these patterns work across themes, if teams change their own palette, it becomes harder. So the idea is to allow themes to still rely on core palettes, and pattern to still rely on core palettes. So for example, when you build a palette, you should probably only use core colors that way it works across themes, if you want to publish it to the pattern directory. And yeah, in terms of UI, it&#8217;s kind of crowded right now, especially in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the idea is that it should get closer and closer to how it looks in the global style bar, which is kind of nested navigation. So the idea is that it should look like the global styles view of colors. So you will see at the high level button to go to the link color, another one to go to the button background and another one to go to the text color. And they are not shown every time, all the colors at the same time. So that way it&#8217;s less crowded and it allows you to navigate more efficiently. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I can and see, that&#8217;s a very good reason to have the block parents be consistent, not so much depending on the theme color scheme, but so it shows up as you see it in the preview. And I can also see to just switch off the core colors in the user interface, so the pattern comes over, but the user can only use the theme and their own color to modify it and not have the core colors as well. Because the core colors always show up on other places when it&#8217;s not a pattern from the repository and using those core colors on other things that might not be wanted by the site owner or the theme author. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah. Theme authors and agencies also want to control these things more strictly. So yeah there is, they is some work in progress to allow actually to remove the core powers entirely. And yeah it&#8217;s going to be sitting in team JSON and you just enable it and it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Awesome. It&#8217;s all so well thought through. Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And there is now also change for the typographic block support. So because we had this change, we discussed about the block tools feature. So now most of the typography controls were added to the existing text blocks, like heading, paragraph and so on. And there are also some default controls enabled for them. So you just go and check those blocks and see how many new options are there now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a great variety there. Yes, indeed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: The next change is another change that is meant to be for WordPress 5.9. So now that global styles are actually the landing in WordPress 5.9, and even the UI, some plugin developers and then some team developers need some API to access these settings and access these styles. If they want to adapt their code. For example, to check whether there&#8217;s a global layout or to retrieve whether I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a color palette or anything, basically any settings in or style in the global style. So a new idea has been introduced, it allows you to retrieve these settings pretty easily in just a function call. You don&#8217;t have to go check directly in the theme JSON file or the user settings or anything, you just get the current value. That&#8217;s pretty handy, another also global style related API that landed pretty recently is actually arrest API to retrieve modified global styles and also the base global styles for the active team. So this could be pretty handy for plug-in and team authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"apis\"><strong>APIs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And regarding the API functions that were introduced, they are called get_global_settings, get global_styles and get global_style sheet. So pretty easy to remember and expect a dev note published in a few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah, I think that was the missing piece that we got quite a few questions about in the community. So having that public API available is now so much better. So believe it or not, we&#8217;re still talking about enhancements and new features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"bug-fixes\"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we, I think there were about 80 or so in them, 73 and we didn&#8217;t talk about all of them, but the bug fixes also are 73 bug fixes in this release. And some of them are very granular and in the back end of it. But the one that stood out for me was that for the blocks, it fixes the relative URLs for the inline styles. So if you had a style sheet with a background color or a background image and the URL if it wasn&#8217;t an absolute URL but only relative like ../ it wouldn&#8217;t find that anymore, and that has been fixed. So quite a few developers will say finally!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: They should still exist in WordPress 5.8. And yeah, this is something we missed because it only happens for the custom blocks and only when you opt in for the option to use those in line styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good. So wasn&#8217;t all that big. Okay. So are there any other bug fixes that you wanted to mention here, Grzegorz or Riad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> No, it&#8217;s like bugs you wanted to forget about them. You don&#8217;t want to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, sometimes I find it interesting to, oh yeah that&#8217;s a bug from 2018, we finally fixed it. But I haven&#8217;t seen any of those here. So yeah, do you want to go to the next section and talk about performance Riad?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"performance\"><strong>Performance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Let&#8217;s speak about performance actually. Pretty interesting subject and I enjoy working on performance a lot. So on the editor theme, we have this metrics we keep track of over time, the loading time, the typing time and we keep adding new metrics every time. And the interesting one that was worked on during this release was the list view. We added a new metric to measure how the editor performs while the list view is open. And the list view is pretty powerful to navigate the editor, but since it shows a long list of blocks, it can create some performance issues sometimes. So a new technique has been used during this release. It&#8217;s called windowing techniques for the technical folks listening to us. Basically it means the list that is currently visible is rendered, but all the remaining items on the list are actually hidden and not rendered at all. Unless you scroll the list and show them. Historically we&#8217;ve been avoiding this kind of solutions because they could have some accessibility issues and also it is very hard to get right. But thanks to the work of contributors, I think Carrie worked this a lot, we now have a solution that we think works pretty well and doesn&#8217;t introduce any accessibility problems. So now they invite you to test this and if there are any issues, please let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So well, thank you. And yes, indeed. The list view is one of the most powerful tools that would come revamped WordPress 5.9, but going back to performance, I know that you all also had this check and we talked about it on the show before, where you had, 30,000 blocks in a post to kind of see the performance of it and measure it from between the different versions. How many blocks do you have in the list view to test this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Oh, we use the exact same post, which I think it&#8217;s a thousand blocks or something like that. It&#8217;s a very long post. You can find it on the Gutenberg repository. You can search for large post @HTML. And it&#8217;s actually executed automatically in the CI. And every time we check the numbers. And on each release post, you can go to the bottom of the post and you see there&#8217;s a table that is there that compares the current release with the previous release and also the current release with the previous WordPress release, so that&#8217;s how we keep track of these things. We also have a separate website, which I think at the moment is not working, but I promise I&#8217;ll fix it very soon where you see the evolution of the different metrics over time for each actual comment. So that way we can pretty easily find the exact comments, the introduced performance regressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, I saw yesterday that was going back in time and checking the performance for WordPress 5.6 and other major releases, and maybe do you have those results? Because I was pretty excited hearing how it changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah I do have results. I think loading time improved quite a bit from WordPress 5.7 And to WordPress 5.8, and in WordPress 5.9, it improved a little bit as well, 200 milliseconds or 300 milliseconds out of 3.5 seconds. The typing time also improved, by 20% or something from WordPress 5.8 and WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other metric that improved a lot between these two versions is inserter opening. We did a lot of work there. And now when you opened the inserter, it is actually quite snappy compared to how it was in the previous version. There is also another one, so the only metric that I think we need to work on a little bit more for this release is block selection. We lost 10% time on it, but I think we can improve this one and do better there. And for the inserter it&#8217;s actually quite impressive because at some point in the inserter, we had collapsible panels. So we didn&#8217;t show a lot of things at the same time when you open the inserter and there&#8217;s collapsible panels, it should open quick, right? And now we show everything at once. So there&#8217;s a lot of things, but we still manage to make it fast. So I&#8217;m pretty proud of about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s impressive. Yes. Yeah, because now we have the inserter we don&#8217;t only have the core blocks, but we also have the theme blocks in there. And then also block patterns, a tab and then another reusable block tab. Yeah. Your website, Riad, I think you shared the link at one point maybe two or three months ago. And you also did performance testing with plugins. Is that a different project or is that pretty much the same kind of performance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah. So what I did is I was curious to check actually if I enable plugin or not, how it impacts the editor&#8217;s performance. So I actually use the exact same metrics. We have these coded up in the plugin, so I can just run the test, enable the plugin, change the plugin and run the test again, right? And then compare the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, I also spend some time with some plugin authors, because in the initial run I had some issues there and I saw some plugins impacted a lot, and I was very happy to see that they were all pretty receptive and we did some work together. And in the end, I will say the major plugins right now are doing good enough. I think that we can always do better, but we are doing good enough. And I actually encourage plugin authors to check the post if they didn&#8217;t see it, because there are their instructions to check their own plugins, to see how their own plugin impacts the editor performance. Because sometimes we get reports that the editor is very slow and I cannot choose the editor or whatever when I type it&#8217;s very slow. And sometimes we cannot do anything about it. So we have to check all the possible reasons that could cause this and plug ins can be a reason. So it&#8217;s important for both plug in authors and users to be aware of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow. That&#8217;s good to know. I think I will come back to you and kind of talk about this, or at least get all the information for the show notes, but also maybe have a block post about it. That&#8217;s a little bit more prominent, because now more and more people are going to use or come on board with adopting Gutenberg and having that resource available is really, really helpful. All right. Well, thank you, Riad, for that little excursion into performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Thanks I&#8217;m always happy to dive there. It&#8217;s my personal favorite feature or favorite topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Aspect, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: &#8230;Topic, I would say favorite topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"documentation\"><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So now we are at the documentation section of the changelog and there were two things that stood out amongst typo changes and improving landing pages and all that one was the block schema and documentation has changed or not has changed particularly, but it&#8217;s better documented in terms of the block JSON. And that&#8217;s the follows the same process as the theme JSON does. Right. Is that what I&#8217;m saying, Grzegorz?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So the view is a new API option in block, JSON, that will allow authors to provide Java script code. That&#8217;s going to be executed only in the front and only when the block is rendered there, so it&#8217;s pretty handy thing. And the other change is, because we are preparing to WordPress 5.9. So both features are for the upcoming major WordPress release is that there will be possibility to define more than one style sheet. And the reason for that is twofold. First, sometimes there are some styles that block author would like to apply to more than one block. So this is a way to share them through using style handle. And the other reason is that plugging out, they also want to add their own styles in a batch mode. So instead of doing their own magic, they can just use the existing APIs and inject that to all the blocks they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I like that instead your own magic, use core magic. Yeah, excellent. Well, thanks for letting us know. So there are some features, of course, the theme JSON documentation has been updated with missing settings and styles that is also in preparation of 5.9 and the version change there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I think that there was link added for ways to keep up with Gutenberg and Full-Site Editing. I suspect that the link is to your resources that you keep up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Keeping up with Gutenberg, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. So that&#8217;s great to see it finally happening because it&#8217;s the best page to look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you are listening to the show and don&#8217;t know what Grzegorz is talking about, in the handbook on core on the make block on the references, there is a page called Keeping up with Gutenberg and it&#8217;s an index page with all the block posts from the teams that work on Gutenberg in chronological order. So it starts from the newest to the oldest, but it&#8217;s per year. So we started that 2020 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the last half of 2020 is in the 2020 page. And this year, November, we are coming up to the end of the year, so we have all the editor meetings, what the theme team does, the design team also, publishers, the tests and the summary of the tests from the FSE program and all the other related posts. I started that because the core make block, within a day or two, you have to scroll to the third or fourth page to find something that was published yesterday. And it was really interesting to do that. So keeping up with Gutenberg index, you can actually Google that now, keeping up with Gutenberg and it comes up first. All right, so is there anything else in the changelog? Oh yeah, we have on the tool sections, we have some FSE backboard and core.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"tools\"><strong>Tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Yeah. That another kind of magic. Basically on each WordPress release, we need to backboard all the changes that are on the Gutenberg plugin and include them into core. Maybe a lot of people don&#8217;t know that&#8217;s a lot of work and that&#8217;s a lot of invisible work. We do that in two separate ways. Basically the JavaScript changes are more automatic. So we do a package NP and package release, and then we include them in core, but we also need to check all the PHP changes that happened in the work Gutenberg plugin and move them into core. And sometimes when we do that, some problems happen. For example, a function that exists in the Gutenberg plugin can exist at the same time on core. So at, on this small period of time, we need to make some adaptation, both code based, to ensure they work together. So a lot of changes on this Gutenberg release are related to that. Yeah I want to send kudos to Robert, the editor tech lead for this release. He did an awesome job to make sure everyone is on the same page and works to make sure all the changes are on WordPress trunk at the right moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. All right. So I think unless…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"code-quality\"><strong>Code Quality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Something, yeah. I have something in the code quality section, it has 25 items. So that&#8217;s great that we still remember about that aspect of work in the lights of the upcoming release and all the work caused by that. So there is new API endpoint it looks like is going to be included in the WordPress core, is it right? So this one is called the WP block V1 URL/details. This one is for the link previews. So this one is getting stable, also plugin authors will be able use to do whatever they need with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Indeed, that could be useful to show previews or get more information about URLs and exploit that in very different ways for plugin authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That feature is such a small feature when you think about it, but it has so much power that it could definitely be explored quite a bit for plugin authors and even do a list of all this week&#8217;s links and then collect them all, might be a good use case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-s-in-active-development-or-discussed-1\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right yeah, so that&#8217;s pretty much it with our Gutenberg changelog this week. Thank you Riad and Grzegorz who get us through it. I think I have only one thing&#8230; So where is WordPress 5.9 now headed? What are the next steps?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: I think as we mentioned to tomorrow is November 16. So it&#8217;s the release of WordPress 5.9 beta 1. I think that&#8217;s the best time for people to test. So I&#8217;m asking everyone just code, download WordPress 5.9. It is the start of a new with Full Site Editing and block teams and all global styles and all navigation on all these features. So go grab your coffee and start a block team and just try things and try to break it and just tell us what goes wrong. And we have a number of weeks to fix all the bug fixes, and we&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. I just also want to point out there is a WordPress beta test plugin in the repository, so you don&#8217;t have to install all that. So you just make it a normal WordPress install and then install the plugin for WordPress beta tester plugin, and the stream would be the point release instead of the daily trunk. But if you are brave, you could also do the daily trunk. There are core committers who actually have run trunk on their personal blogs. They&#8217;re quite brave in doing that. So yeah, beta 1 is tomorrow, November 16th, and then a week later, supposedly beta 2, the first release candidate is scheduled. And of course, that all depends on what the test was bringing all back to us or to the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Release candidate, we know sometimes there&#8217;s beta 3 and beta 4, depending on how that all works, but then there&#8217;s a release candidate. One is scheduled for November 30th, and that&#8217;s also the date where the field guide with the dev notes come out and where the about page is done, and also the release post is draft and there&#8217;s a hard string freeze, means there is no bug fixing anymore. And there&#8217;s not a whole lot that can go in there in a release candidate after release candidate is available. And then there will be a dry run for the releasing workers, 5.9 in the 24 hour code freeze December 13th. But if you want to be part of the release party, that&#8217;s going to happen December 14th in the slack channel of core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: And it&#8217;s something else I wanted to mention about WordPress 5.9 Is the dev notes. So after beta one, you can expect a list of dev notes on the make core and if you are a plugin author or an agency or WordPress developer app, update your code accordingly, if there are changes and also use the new APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful, thank you for a reminder of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: You can also subscribe to the Gutenberg changelog newsletter and get the list with all the links directly from Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you for making a pitch on the Gutenberg Times again. That&#8217;s awesome. And if you need instructions on how to test Full-Site Editing, so Anne McCarthy published a test call for the Full-Site Editing outreach program. That&#8217;s for the non-techy people who are using site builder or page builders to build sites for others. And it&#8217;s called the site editing safari, and you get different scenarios that you can follow along with instructions on how to test this because&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Also with zebras, giraffes and elephants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: What about Chrome and Firefox? Is this just a safari?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good point? No, safari is like the African safari with the giraffes and the rhinos and everything. So one scenario is personalize your homepage and setting your styles. Add some button patterns and use some of the layout controls for that, one set of instructions also is how to add a dual filter and the single post template. Those test instructions are actually also quite nicely to use for exploring the new interface on a more scripted schedule. So you don&#8217;t have to come up with ideas on how to test it. So you just use those and it really helps if you would comment on that post on the test block by November 30th. And then what normally happens is after a week or so, the feedback comes in and then Anne writes a summary for the developers working on it so they can see what else then to be changed, or she also puts issues together for the GitHub repository of a box coming out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I also want to mention one more thing. So the release date, December 14, it reminded me that it&#8217;s also the day when the state of the word 2021 will be by the WordPress projects co-founder Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yes, yes. And that is scheduled for, I think it&#8217;s noon Eastern, which is dinner time in central Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So it&#8217;s 10:00 AM between 10:00 AM and 2:12 PM Eastern time and 5:00 PM UTC, which means at my place, it would be 6:00 PM Central European Time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. I&#8217;m glad we got it all in. Yes. And so on the webpress.org/news, there is actually a call for of questions because the state of the word is normally about 45 minutes when Matt Mullenweg walks us through the last year and what&#8217;s coming up in the next year and then the next 30 minutes or so will be answering questions from the community. And there is some instructions on the webpress.org/newspost instructions, you can send them via a video and how to get them to the people who help prepare for the state of the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, with that, that&#8217;s a very good time to end it. If you like our shows, help us spreading the word by adding a review to your favorite podcast directory.

So my Twitter handle is at B-P-H. Grzegorz is G-Z-I-O-L-O. And then Riad&#8217;s Twitter handle is Riad Benguella. And we will of course share that all in the show notes. So it was wonderful to have you both here. Thank you, Riad for joining us. How do you feel about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Riad Benguella</em>: Thank you. I really enjoyed the show and thank you for having me and please do continue to spread the Gutenberg word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Will do. Will Do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That was fun. Yeah, to have fun to have Riad on the shows like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Probably that was the best I show ever. We had so much fun together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, we did. All right. Okay. Well, let&#8217;s just get out of here for more fun. Thank you all for listening.

Could I convince you to do a HeroPress essay?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is now October and I&#8217;m finally writing this essay. Thank you for being so patient with me and giving me a topic to write about.</p>\n<h2>How I got into the WordPress</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s 2017 and I&#8217;m bored with work. I&#8217;d been working in project management for over 15 years and I was no longer excited about the projects I was working on. My repeat clients could tell this, I did not challenge them on certain processes. Some might say I&#8217;d become wiser in picking my battles, but I just no longer wanted to invest my energy. When that happens, you know you need to do something. You don&#8217;t want your action, or in my case inaction, to be to the detriment of the client. I knew I still loved working with and in tech but I needed to do something different.</p>\n<p>On 29 December 2017, I enrolled on a course covering web development. After covering HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, I decided to try one of the course options: WordPress. My course instructor encouraged me to go to a WordCamp. She found one was scheduled for the following weekend in Brighton. So I booked my ticket and found an Airbnb. Worst case scenario I get to spend some time on the beach (even if it was a bit chilly). But I couldn&#8217;t go to a WordCamp with no knowledge of WordPress &#8211; I thought I&#8217;d look like an idiot. So I spent that week going through the introductory course, now I was ready. Don&#8217;t ask me how much I managed to take in, just know that at least I now knew what WordPress was.</p>\n<p>I attended my first WordCamp, a 2-hour drive, in October 2018. WordCamp Brighton (WCBTN) will always hold a special place in my heart. All the people I met (sponsors, attendees, organising team, and volunteers) were amazing. I walked in there all by my lonesome and they were friendly, took time to talk to me, explain things, and Jenny Wong encouraged me to join my local Meetup. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s being in a room with like-minded people or being able to geek out (or not for some) on tech but I was excited and had a lot of fun. When I got back to London, I joined my local (well what I like to call London local) Meetup.</p>\n<p>At the time that I joined, the team was starting to look for organisers for WordCamp London (WCLDN) 2019. I&#8217;m very much a believer in learning by doing and project management involves a lot of organisation. I spoke to Gary Jones told him I was a newbie and offered to help. I was in charge of Sponsors, eek! How the hell do I do that? Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask a lot of questions. We were a fairly new team so big thanks to Dan Maby and Barbara Saul for being patient with us and our endless questions. Big thanks to the outgoing team who were available to offer advice when asked. I learnt a lot about the community whilst working on the WCLDN and I had a great time doing it.</p>\n<p>Abha Thakor encouraged me to volunteer for WordCamp Europe (WCEU) 2019 and once again it was an amazing experience. I got to visit Berlin, contribute to the Marketing team desk and met even more people. I also got to rock my big yellow exclamation mark fluorescent earrings that scream the 80s at an 80s after party. It was during WCEU Contributor day that I was introduced to Jesse Owens and the Training team. When you contribute, you get to learn more about all the different teams that make up WordPress the project and WordPress itself. It&#8217;s a great way to learn and I would encourage you to join one of the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\"> Make teams</a> (you don&#8217;t need to be a developer) there are teams like Training, Accessibility, Documentation, Marketing, and Polyglots. If you want to test the waters before joining, find a virtual Contributor day (some companies are running them) or join one at a WordCamp when we are able to meet in person. I joined the Marketing and Training team at WCEU and I&#8217;m still there today.</p>\n<p>In November 2019 Josepha Haden Chomphosy sent out a call for an all-women release squad. I wanted to know more about accessibility so I was assigned to be the 5.8 Accessibility team cohort. The support our release squad got was amazing. The beauty of the WordPress community is that though we are all at different levels on our journey, someone is always quick to help you navigate that journey. Thank you to everyone who takes the time to make us feel welcome, explain things, are patient with us, and offer cake and chocolate when we need it. I’m still part of the Accessibility team and I’m still learning, it’s a big topic. We are a small team so if you’re an expert in that area and have time to spare, you want to teach others or want to learn, I encourage you to come and join us.</p>\n<p>Summer of 2020 was the soft launch of <a href=\"http://learn.wordpress.org\">Learn.WordPress.org</a>. Shortly afterwards, Courtney Robertson asked for help in preparing for the official launch of Learn. Learn WordPress is a learning resource for anyone who wants to learn how to use, build for and contribute to WordPress. It is an open-source platform that offers a range of materials and opportunities for you to use at your own pace and at a time that works for you. Once again, I put my hand up. Do you see a pattern here? When people have ideas that are of great value to those around them, I can’t help but say yes. Someone always has a great idea and I would love to say yes to everyone but I don’t know how to clone myself yet. Mind you, Michelle Frechette tells me cloning isn’t what I think it is, I need to do more research.</p>\n<h2>The life it now gives me and why I stay</h2>\n<p>Since discovering WordPress, I’ve been a part of a lot of different projects within Make and in the community.</p>\n<p>I am one of the Training Team Reps. I get to work with folks that I like and be involved in shaping Learn. As Courtney Robertson, my good friend and fellow Training Team Rep, puts it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want to democratise Learning and make Learn WordPress the primary open-source resource for anyone who wants to get started or level up their skills in WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am proud to be involved in a project that is a cross-team initiative, props to marketing, community, meta, polyglots, accessibility, design, training, and<a href=\"http://wordpress.tv\"> WordPress.tv</a> who help shape Learn. Individuals can learn alongside other community members, connecting with the global network of WordPress users, developers and contributors.

It is the second 100% block theme that integrates with WooCommerce to land in the WordPress directory. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/responsive-fse/\">Responsive FSE</a> was the first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, a reader sent in a question for the Ask the Bartender column. He wanted to know <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-where-are-the-woocommerce-block-themes\">where the WooCommerce block themes were</a>. Literally one day after publishing that post, Wowmall was submitted to the WordPress theme review system. Maybe it was fate or just luck, but I had no choice but to give it a test run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme adds an admin-side welcome and notice page. The author makes it clear that the project is not currently intended for use on production sites. It is in an experimental state at the moment.  It is unclear who is actually behind the Wowmall project. The associated Twitter account has been suspended, and its other social profiles are devoid of information. And, the <a href=\"https://wowmall.store/\">Wowmall website</a> currently offers scant details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will not pretend that Wowmall is one of my favorite themes. The design is far too busy for my tastes. I prefer something scaled back that focuses on content, but I do not fit into this theme&rsquo;s primary audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an eCommerce theme, it is much cleaner than others I have seen, and it leverages almost every piece of the block system. It ships over 30 block patterns. Six of those are headers, and another three are footers. However, the rest are for general use in the content, including call-to-action layouts and hero sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A call-to-action pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>It also ships several custom block styles. Some of them offer design variations that make up for things like missing border controls for some blocks. Others, such as the Social Icon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dark&rdquo; style, would be better left to the existing color options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question most people likely want to be answered is how well it works with WooCommerce. From what I have seen, it works like any other run-of-the-mill WooCommerce theme. You know the look, the default design as seen by 90% of the themes built for the eCommerce plugin. Maybe there is a custom color palette or simple stylistic changes. However, at the end of the day, you know it is a WooCommerce shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Wowmall <a href=\"https://wowmall.store/demo/shop/\">shop page</a>.\n\n\n\n<p>If it works, do not mess with the formula. The most egregious issue I saw with the WooCommerce part of the theme was the output of a comments section on the main Shop page and product category archives. I did not see specific block templates for these pages, so I am taking a wild stab and assuming everything is falling back to a single product or page template that would normally output comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wowmall does not work well as a pure blogging theme. It handles the basics well enough, but it has far too many characters per line for comfortably reading long-form content. A strict 18px font size, a variable-width content area (989px at full-width on my laptop), and a medium-gray text color make it hard to read anything other than short blurbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this theme is not touted as a blogging theme. It is hyper-focused on presenting an online shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the theme flexes the most is its selection of block patterns. They are designed primarily for building out a unique storefront. Users can get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The breadcrumb trail in the theme is not really a breadcrumb trail at all. It just masquerades as one. Under the hood, it is a Navigation block with a homepage link followed by the current post/page title. At no point does it show the crumbs (e.g., parent pages) that lead back to the site root. Themes have notoriously offered sub-par breadcrumb navigation in the classic era. Perhaps, developers will leave this to plugin authors in their block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as I know, there are no breadcrumb navigation plugins on WordPress.org to integrate with. However, there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21943\">proposal to add a block</a> for it in core. And, for transparency, I have such a plugin under development and intend to release it on .ORG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wowmall is not claiming this is a finished, production-ready WordPress theme. It is an ongoing project that is expected to improve over time. Plus, we are still waiting for WooCommerce to expand its support of the block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I like more than anything is seeing theme shops push the envelope with blocks. What I see from Wowmall and recent block themes is that many of the limitations of the past year or so are simply no longer there.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 23:35:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: State of the Word 2021 Will Be Broadcast Live from New York City on December 14\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125723\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:223:\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-will-be-broadcast-live-from-new-york-city-on-december-14?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=state-of-the-word-2021-will-be-broadcast-live-from-new-york-city-on-december-14\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4517:\"<p>WordPress executive director Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">announced</a> today that the 2021 State of the Word will be held on December 14, <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit/copy/XzY0czNjZGhuNjhyNDJiYTE4NTMzMmI5azZ0MmsyYmEyNjBwNGFiYTE2c3IzZ2NhMjhvbzQ0Z3BrNm8gdHVhOWpudTg4ZHRiZnIzNGpzZGI5a3U1bGNAZw\">between 10 am and 12 pm ET/3 pm and 5 pm UTC</a>. For those who are new to the WordPress community, this event is where Matt Mullenweg reviews the milestones and progress of the past year and shares his vision for the open source WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinarily, the State of the Word is delivered as the capstone to WordCamp US in the latter part of the year, with a live Q&amp;A session following the address. This year, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2021-kicks-off-online-in-48-hours\">WordCamp US was held online</a> in early October and concluded with Haden Chomphosy discussing trends she observed in 2020 and growth opportunities she sees for the WordPress community. In her most recent <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/episode-20-wordpressblogging/\">podcast</a>, Haden Chomphosy confirmed that the State of the Word 2021 will be an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to join the growing list of in-person events that are on the calendar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will be in New York City but will also be live-streamed across the world as usual.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about live event, Haden Chomphosy further clarified that it will be more like a mid-sized meetup. Mullenweg will be delivering the State of the Word at Automattic&rsquo;s New York office with approximately 30 people in-person, which is the capacity for the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start with NYC community folks, but will try to keep the invitation process as open as possible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Vaccinations will be required and more information will be available about that later this week.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement said that attendees and viewers can expect to hear about WordPress 5.9, Openverse (WordPress&rsquo; search engine project for openly-licensed media), and Web3 and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The last topic drew some early responses on Twitter from those who are keenly interested in Web3 and NFTs, as well as those who don&rsquo;t see any value in the WordPress project promoting or participating in these technologies. As WordPress is <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">closing in on 43% of the web</a>, it will be interesting to see what Mullenweg has to say about what the project&rsquo;s role is in this potentially polarizing issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\'Expect to hear about a range of topics, from WordPress 5.9 and Openverse to Web3 and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\'<br /><br />All I want to hear about Web3 and NFTs is \'The WP project itself will do nothing to encourage these questionable technologies.\' <a href=\"https://t.co/T3LnU21HuZ\">https://t.co/T3LnU21HuZ</a></p>&mdash; Simon Dickson (@simond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simond/status/1459430909325807617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 13, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Annual State of the Word 2021 &ndash; an event to reflect on the WordPress project&rsquo;s progress and the future of open source.

The feature would allow themes to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35619\">ship multiple <code>theme.json</code> files</a>, housing variations on a site&rsquo;s default styles. Essentially, it is the old-school concept of &ldquo;skins.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How the feature would work is not yet defined. However, theme authors would presumably be allowed to bundle separate JSON files that create user-selectable &ldquo;global style variations&rdquo; or &ldquo;active styles&rdquo; via the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is almost as if we have come full circle. The original implementation of child themes allowed developers to create custom <code>style.css</code> files. The goal was to design skins that changed a site&rsquo;s look and feel without changing its markup. Child themes have become much more flexible since then and can overwrite anything from their parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many themers still build on top of that original concept. Their child themes are nothing more than a custom stylesheet with design modifications. The ability to bundle multiple style variations from a single theme could change how they approach design, perhaps even offering a better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kjell Reigstad first teased this feature last month when <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/10/06/introducing-twenty-twenty-two/\">announcing the upcoming new default theme</a>. &ldquo;Twenty Twenty-Two will ship with a range of alternate color schemes so that folks can drastically change the appearance of their site,&rdquo; he wrote in the post.  The following is a video of what this concept might look like:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI in the video appears to be a mockup for the site editor. In the right sidebar panel, users can switch between alternate styles and find something that works well for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal would allow for more than color palette variations. Theme authors would be able to adjust typography, layout, and anything else controllable via <code>theme.json</code> &mdash; essentially, the entire theme design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the feature is not yet in the Gutenberg plugin or in the development version of WordPress, the only way to explore multiple <code>theme.json</code> files is through child theming. Yes, child themes are being used to test the very concept that could make them, at least partially, obsolete. Reigstad has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/pull/292\">open pull request</a> in the Theme Experiments repository to flesh out the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channing Ritter, an Automattic-sponsored WordPress contributor, <a href=\"https://critterverse.blog/2021/11/10/a-global-styles-switcher/\">shared three variations</a> of what the user experience may look like on her blog. My preferred option is the first. It is a drill-down panel that shows &ldquo;active styles&rdquo; that users can switch between.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting active theme style from sidebar panel.\n\n\n\n<p>Building an active-style switcher into the global styles interface could offer that ideal user experience that child themes have never achieved. Users had to first understand how they worked, know if any existed for their active theme, install one, and activate it. Under this proposal, they could see all the styles available upfront and simply select one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gives end-users who are not as design-savvy some variety without forcing them to hand-pick an entire color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while now, I have been imagining a future where theme shops narrow their focus to one, two, or just a handful of core themes. They would then upsell access to support and a library of block patterns. Now, I envision a future where global style variations could play a part in the commercial market, offering value-adds on top of that core product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a second ticket that calls for themes to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36304\">provide alternate color palettes</a>. This would likely be much easier to implement as a separate feature because it is much more scaled back. With only a month to get WordPress 5.9 and Twenty Twenty-Two out of the door with user-selectable color schemes, this may be the more reasonable of the two routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case may be, I keep finding new pet features I want to see land in WordPress. Yesterday, it was block patterns. Today, it is &ldquo;active styles,&rdquo; or whatever it gets called. Tomorrow, who knows? New ideas around the block system continue to keep me impatiently awaiting what comes next.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:04:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 20: WordPress=Blogging+\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11556\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/episode-20-wordpressblogging/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10273:\"<p>In this episode, WordPress&#8217;s Executive Director, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, answers two recently asked questions.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was in a meeting recently, which I realize isn&#8217;t saying much for me since I spend a quarter of my time in meetings. But in this particular meeting, I was asked a couple of questions that I absolutely loved. The first question was, “if there were one thing you could change in people&#8217;s minds about WordPress, what would it be?” And my answer, predictable though it may be, was that I want to change the idea that WordPress is just a blogging platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:06</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has grown into a lot more than that. But the idea of a content management system, even now, sometimes gets a mental shorthand where content is a stand-in for the word writing or words. If you&#8217;re using WordPress today in an enterprise context, or as part of a governmental agency, or if you use it in a classroom setting, you know that your content cannot be confined that way. And if you&#8217;re supporting or building anything to hand off to clients, you know that timely, easy-to-ship changes on a site are considered a vital part of any overarching brand and marketing strategy. And when was the last time that any marketing strategy was literally only about the words?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was the first question. And also my first answer. There is also this kind of annual, not fear, necessarily, but this annual question that is sort of related that is raised to me and has been asked of me recently, that I&#8217;m just going to give you a small answer to. One annual worry that I get every year around November and December is, &#8220;What are we going to do about the fact that the term blog and blogging are declining in search popularity?&#8221; And I was gonna say it&#8217;s been a while since I answered that in any sort of public format. But I think maybe I&#8217;ve never answered it in a public format at all. And so I&#8217;m just going to answer it here. Because I think maybe a lot of people have that same question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So number one, I think that the way that people search now is different. There&#8217;s a lot more semantic cognition. This is not the way to answer this &#8212;  search engines are smarter now. So like, it used to be the case with early search engines that yeah, there was a lot of just like, individual search terms that were looked for. But now, people are asking full questions; they have, essentially, an entire sentence that they are searching for. And then, search engines are able to parse that information better and get more high-quality answers and information for them. So like, that&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m already not worried about. If people are searching for individual words anymore, it&#8217;s so that they can get a definition of that word. So I&#8217;m not specifically worried about a decline in search volume for the word blog or blogging for that reason. But the answer to my first question, if there is probably the real reason that I&#8217;m not actually super worried about any decline in search volume for the word blog, or blogging, is that WordPress has really moved beyond that. And since we have moved beyond that, then it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make sense for WordPress as an entity for WordPress as a project to get overly hung up on the idea that the term blog has gone out of fashion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now that I did my first question, and the answer, and then an additional question that only ever gets asked in private and is being answered by me for the first time in public, I will tell you now, the second question that I loved, someone asking of me, and that question is this: &#8220;What is one thing you&#8217;d like people to see or experience, right when they first land on wordpress.org?&#8221; Now, I often don&#8217;t get asked questions about the wordpress.org website, like administrative tasks, things that we need to update, move around where they should go. Sure. But like, “Josepha, what&#8217;s the point and purpose of this site?” Never. I&#8217;ve never been asked that, and so I was really excited that someone asked me, and I&#8217;m going to give you a heads up. I think some of you might disagree with my answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the primary thing that I want people to see or experience when they first get to wordpress.org, the website is the depth of WordPress. Not which audience segment they should belong to or that we believe they should belong to or raw data about the CMS or even how much we care about the freedoms of open source. Now the first thing I want people to see on that site is that WordPress has not only 18 years of learned knowledge that every single new user benefits from, but that it also has 1,000s of really smart people making sure it works and gets better every day, now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a Goliath in its field. I know that we cite this bit of context. Frequently, we say that we are 42% of the web. And that is true that is the percentage by usage. But in its field, which is websites that are using a content management system, we actually have a 65% market share. This is very easy to find. It&#8217;s on the W3Techs website: I can put a link in the show notes, but you could find it just by searching for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress is a Goliath in its field of websites that are run using a CMS. Because we have always brought our learnings forward with us with the understanding that knowledge, when shared grows rather than diminishes. But open source, the heart of what defines this project, open source is not a Goliath; it&#8217;s barely even David somedays. Even though the web is built on scads of open source software, there&#8217;s a pervasive public perception that it is built by and for hobbyists or that it is inherently risky, and that if there were if it were worth something, then people would pay something. And I just know that if the first impression of WordPress, we&#8217;re, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got 18 years of experience and learning that brought us to today,&#8221; the rest of the sale to adopt software that protects other people&#8217;s freedoms would take care of itself. And I guess, to quote John Oliver, at this point, &#8220;And now this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, that brings us now to our small list of big things. There are actually quite a few big things on this small list today. So number one, we have reached the beta phase for the year&#8217;s final release, which means that WordPress 5.9 beta one is happening tomorrow, Tuesday, November 16. And then seven days later, I believe on the 23rd, if I recall correctly, comes beta two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that team rep nominations are happening all over the project right now. I&#8217;ve got a post that I will share in the notes below that I believe all the team reps have put their team&#8217;s nomination posts on. So if you have had an interest in learning more about that and what it means to help keep teams kind of running in the WordPress project, then this is a great opportunity to check those out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing, this last thing actually isn&#8217;t in the next two weeks, but it is very important, nonetheless. Matt&#8217;s annual State of the Word is coming up on December 14. So basically a month from today. It&#8217;s going to join the growing list of in-person events that are on the calendar. It will be in New York City but will also be live-streamed across the world as usual. Keep an eye out for additional updates about that for anyone who, like me, really looks forward to this particular presentation from our project co-founder every year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing.

Contributors are speeding forward, getting in some of the final features before the release of WordPress 5.9, expected on December 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.9 is the last plugin release to include new features for the upcoming WordPress update. Bug fixes will continue to be ported over in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site editing and theme-related blocks take up most of the spotlight. WordPress 5.9 will ship with its first default block theme, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-wordpress-upcoming-twenty-twenty-two-default-theme-the-most-flexible-default-theme-ever-created-for-wordpress\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a>. For many users, this will be their first experience with template editing and global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Navigation block received a lot of attention, and rightly so. Developers solved some vital data portability issues and created a more well-rounded user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still a lot of room for improvement on the whole, but Gutenberg has come a long way in the past few months. I am excited about what the new features will look like once they land in the general WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"site-editor-scaled-back-its-menu-moved-and-renamed\">Site Editor Scaled Back, Its Menu Moved and Renamed</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Site editor with Twenty Twenty-Two active.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The site editor has been scaled back to the point where it is no longer the feature that Gutenberg plugin users have grown accustomed to in these last few months. It is essentially a pathway to the global styles feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to templates, only the site&rsquo;s homepage is accessible through the interface. Clicking the &ldquo;W&rdquo; icon in the top left of the editor <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36194\">no longer opens the familiar templates panel</a>, which formerly allowed users to navigate, select, and customize individual templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking the &ldquo;Browse All Templates&rdquo; button carts users away from the site editor to a templates screen. It looks like a posts list and includes no instructions on how to, for example, overwrite an author archive or other theme templates. I know the system well enough to understand what is happening, but I can only imagine this would be shocking for the average user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can jump to the Header and Footer areas in the site editor by clicking those in the dropdown. The editor simply focuses on those template parts without switching screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I see no way of editing specific templates from within the site editor.  The result is a watered-down index template editor with global styles, the one redeeming feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor menu item has also now been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29630\">moved beneath the Appearance menu</a> in the WordPress admin. It is now simply named &ldquo;Editor.&rdquo; Of course, the &ldquo;Theme Editor&rdquo; submenu is still there.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Two types of Appearance editors.\n\n\n\n<p><em>I do not expect this to be confusing to users at all&hellip;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarcasm aside, this is the appropriate place for the new site editor, which will only appear if a user has a block theme active. However, the two submenu names clearly conflict. Could there be a better place to move the Theme Editor? One proposal would see it <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/36354\">dropped under Tools</a> in the admin menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One must wonder how much use there will be for directly editing theme files in a block world. Templates can be overwritten via the UI. <code>theme.json</code> settings are handled through the global styles interface. That mostly just leaves <code>functions.php</code> as the lone holdout. It might just be time to disable file editing by default in WordPress, at least for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pattern-explorer\">Pattern Explorer</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Block pattern explorer.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users on desktops and tablets can now enjoy a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35773\">full-screen pattern overlay</a>. Instead of endlessly scrolling through dozens or even hundreds of patterns in the narrow inserter, they can click a new &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; button to <em>explore</em> patterns in an interface with a bit more breathing room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I covered this new feature in a full <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-pattern-modal-explorer-coming-to-wordpress-5-9\">review earlier this week</a>. There are still a few kinks to work out with the design, but it works well thus far. It also lays the groundwork for a more extensive set of features down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"navigation-data-saving-and-navigation-area-block\">Navigation Data Saving and Navigation Area Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Navigation block <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35746\">data is now stored</a> in a dedicated <code>wp_navigation</code> post type. By saving it separately, contributors have now corrected one of the longstanding issues with block-based nav menus: portability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In previous iterations of the block, users lost their carefully-crafted menus whenever they switched to a new block theme. They would have to recreate content that typically does not change often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside this improvement is a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/36178\">Navigation Area block</a>, which serves as a wrapper for Navigation. Theme authors will be able to define custom areas in their block theme templates with the following code:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!-- wp:navigation-area {\"area\":\"primary\"} --&gt;\n&lt;!-- wp:navigation /--&gt;\n&lt;!-- /wp:navigation-area --&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The nested Navigation block is associated with a <code>wp_navigation</code> <em>post</em>. This will be the preferred format for theme authors going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a user switches themes and the &ldquo;area&rdquo; name matches their previous theme, the menu simply carries over and automatically appears. If they do not match, the user can assign a saved menu. The menu/area relationship is stored in the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the issues with the Navigation Area block is that it has no alignment controls. Technically, it does not output any HTML itself. However, its existence in the editor prohibits a user from selecting wide or full alignment for its inner Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"duotone-filter-transparency\">Duotone Filter Transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Duotone filters on blocks such as Image and Cover <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34130\">now support transparency</a>. Users will now see a slider control beneath the color picker when adjusting either shadows or highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature opens the door for a double exposure effect or image mask by layering an Image block over a Cover. Alex Lende showed a few examples of how this could work in the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image with transparent duotone layered over Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>Developers also noted possibilities for a tritone option and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35359\">other filter types</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"api-for-accessing-global-styles\">API For Accessing Global Styles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Theme and plugin authors should have fun with this new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34843\">API for interacting</a> with the global styles system. Previously, developers had to use the <code>WP_Theme_JSON_Resolver</code> class to pull data that they needed on the server side. Now, they have three new functions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>gutenberg_get_global_settings()</code> &ndash; Returns settings.</li><li><code>gutenberg_get_global_styles()</code> &ndash; Returns style settings.</li><li><code>gutenberg_get_global_stylesheet()</code> &ndash; Returns the global stylesheet.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Presumably, these functions will be renamed before landing in WordPress 5.9 and not have the <code>gutenberg_</code> prefix. Theme authors should wrap any usage of these in <code>function_exist()</code> checks to be on the safe side.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"new-comment-blocks\">New Comment Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Several new comment blocks have landed in the latest plugin update. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35231\">Comments Query Loop and Comment Template</a> blocks work similarly to their post counterparts. However, the current result is a bare-bones feature that is not ready for production use. Nested comments are not shown, and there are not many options for customizing the output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a step toward block theme authors and users (via the site editor) controlling post comments output. Gutenberg 11.9 also includes new comment helper blocks that will be necessary for templating:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35774\">Comment Reply Link</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35965\">Comment Link</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35396\">Comment Avatar</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while, comments have felt like an afterthought. Any movement toward rounding out these missing theme-related blocks is welcome.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 01:34:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WordPress.org blog: State of the Word 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11567\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4429:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/11/SOTW-Post-e1636763589410-1024x696.png?resize=632%2C430&ssl=1\" alt=\"State of the Word 2021\" class=\"wp-image-11568\" />State of the Word 2021 is happening on Dec 14!</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Howdy, World!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit?text=State+of+the+Word+2021+livestream&dates=20211214T220000Z/20211215T000000Z&details=State+of+the+Word+is+the+annual+keynote+address+delivered+by+the+WordPress+project%27s+co-founder,+Matt+Mullenweg.%0AJoin+Matt+as+he+provides+a+retrospective+of+2021,+celebrates+the+community%27s+amazing+wins,+discusses+the+latest+trends+he%27s+seeing,+and+explores+the+future+of+open+source.%0AState+of+the+Word+will+be+live+streamed+from+New+York+City,+and+is+free+for+all+to+watch.%0Ahttps://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/state-of-the-word-2021/\">Mark your calendars</a>; it’s almost time for State of the Word 2021!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State of the Word is the annual keynote address delivered by the WordPress project’s co-founder, Matt Mullenweg.

Pagely, co-founded by Joshua and Sally Strebel, has been in business for 18 years, offering hosting for businesses and enterprises at the higher end of the managed hosting market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We will be working closely with the amazing team of WooCommerce experts from SkyVerge (previous GoDaddy acquisition) on the GoDaddy commerce team to deploy a world-class WooCommerce SaaS aimed at powersellers,&rdquo; Pagely co-founder and CEO Joshua Strebel said in a post titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://pagely.com/blog/we-did-it/\">We Did It</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strebel said Pagely received more than a dozen offers to buy the company over the years and was given the &ldquo;choice of every suitor in the space.&rdquo; This particular offer was the third from GoDaddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We poured our heart and soul into Pagely, and PressNomics, and the market responded,&rdquo; Strebel said. &ldquo;First, shown by our own success and then that of all the followers that came along after.&nbsp;We built a company with industry-leading&nbsp;<em>everything &ndash;&nbsp;</em>that our employees and customers love and respect, and despite our diminutive size in comparison to the VC fueled giants, those same entities could not ignore us. And that pushed the entire channel to improve and do better, benefiting every WordPress user on the planet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. I spoke with both Pagely and GoDaddy representatives who would not elaborate on how the new WooCommerce Saas will be different from GoDaddy&rsquo;s current WordPress e-commerce hosting offering. WooCommerce stores at GoDaddy start at $15.99/month and include 75 extensions and daily back-ups, among other features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uE2s3Of_AU\">interview</a> with Post Status last night, GoDaddy product manager Beka Rice said Pagely will be involved in deploying the new WooCommerce product, which she described as a &ldquo;curated experience&rdquo; for merchants. GoDaddy will be relying on Pagely&rsquo;s infrastructure expertise to improve the company&rsquo;s ability to keep WooCommerce stores running smoothly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about a potential launch date for the new WooCommerce SaaS product, Rice said the project is still in the the planning stages. They have identified the teams and are interested in learning more about scaling WooCommerce from Pagely&rsquo;s enterprise customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pagely co-founder and COO Sally Strebel confirmed that the company will continue sponsoring and hosting its annual Pressnomics conference, which has held six events since it began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our beloved conference,&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pressnomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pressnomics</a>, may look a little different going forward, and will remain a Pagely hosted event with the same mission as always: to elevate and connect business owners in the WordPress ecosystem,&rdquo; Strebel said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 19:29:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: Proposed Web Fonts API Not Coming to WordPress 5.9, Possibly Landing in Gutenberg First\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125634\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:237:\"https://wptavern.com/proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=proposed-web-fonts-api-not-coming-to-wordpress-5-9-possibly-landing-in-gutenberg-first\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6763:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">After what seemed like a shoo-in for WordPress 5.9, a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-web-font-api-possibly-coming-to-wordpress\">proposed web font API</a> was put on hold. The feature would standardize how theme and plugin developers load fonts and lay the groundwork for future user-facing features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jono Alderson <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46370\">opened a ticket</a> for the feature in February 2019. In recent months, the proposal picked up speed. The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/1736\">pull request</a> had over 200 in-ticket messages, 93 commits, and code approval from two core committers. The API seemed ready. However, it hit a standstill in the past few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Ozz, a lead WordPress developer, essentially <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/1736#issuecomment-963589490\">halted the possibility of the new API</a> landing in 5.9. He stated that he did not think the proposal was ready for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Purely as code it looks good,&rdquo; he wrote in the ticket. &ldquo;It is really well documented (thanks [Tonya Mark]!). However I still cannot see how this would make WordPress better in the short and long run. We were chatting with [Andrei Draganescu] and he suggested that ideally this should have been a feature plugin, and I agree. Then it would have been possible to really test it in production, verify (or reject) the assumptions that were made while creating it, and make it into a really worthy addition to WordPress. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s too late for this now for 5.9.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the issues with testing feature plugins for APIs is that they are not often adopted, as others noted in the ticket. Developers would not rely on them in production in most cases. And, the average end-user would not install something specific to developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Suggesting this be done as a feature plugin is an elegant way to delay something for a few years,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/1736#issuecomment-963893355\">said Ari Stathopoulos</a>, one of the developers behind the API. However, he pointed out the REST API being one exception that performed well enough to get ported into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core WordPress proposal will likely be <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46370#comment:111\">pushed into the Gutenberg plugin</a> for further exploration. This would be a sort of compromise between launching as a separate feature plugin and going into WordPress 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web fonts API is not directly related to the block system. Both traditional and block themes, as well as plugins, could make use of the feature today. However, several Gutenberg proposals rely on the existence of the API, such as allowing theme authors to define web fonts via their <code>theme.json</code> files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz listed several questions around the proposal, and several developers replied to each. However, his primary argument hinged on the practicality of why everything in the API was necessary, stating that prior replies had been &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; and seemed to be based on assumptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the most basic level, the web fonts API would allow developers to register and load locally-hosted fonts or those from Google Fonts. Developers could also add custom providers outside of the two defaults. The first iteration of the proposed API was more about setting down a foundation to build upon in future WordPress releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal of the feature is not simply loading fonts. Technically, theme authors could do that with a single line of code if they wanted to. Four lines of code if they wanted to follow current core WordPress standards, at least on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stathopoulos rattled off a list of improvements such an API would bring to WordPress and its extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Themes could define fonts via their <code>theme.json</code> files.</li><li>Font previews in the font-family selector in the editor.</li><li>Showing valid font-weights and styles for a font-family.</li><li>Improved front-end performance.</li><li>Server-side localization for better performance and privacy.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a small sampling of the arguments in favor of including the API in core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are many improvements in Gutenberg that are in limbo, waiting for a web fonts API,&rdquo; wrote Stathopolous in the ticket. &ldquo;Not having a web fonts API is a blocker at this point. It&rsquo;s not a good-to-have item in our wishlist, it is a requirement in order to move forward.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, no standard specifically relates to web fonts in WordPress. Theme authors piggyback off existing functions for enqueueing a third-party stylesheet or a custom one with <code>@font-face</code> rules. That has generally been an accepted practice in the theme author community over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many have accepted it grudgingly. Several have created custom scripts to ease pain points. Many others just copy whatever method the latest default WordPress theme happens to be using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the goals is to make it so that developers do not have to worry about doing all of the extra work involved with loading web fonts. There really should be no need for a theme to figure out how to load them in both the editor and the front end, handle preloading, or account for localization. As themes age and third-party APIs like Google Fonts change, there would be no need for themes to update if WordPress takes care of it under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem of how best to load web fonts multiplies when you throw plugins into the mix. Generally, themes do all the heavy lifting when it comes to design. However, some plugins leap into that side of the WordPress world to add extra style options. There is no way to solve conflicts when loading multiple copies of the same font. Nor are there any surefire ways to disable a theme&rsquo;s fonts and replace them via the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such plugin author emailed me to let me know the news I had already known. The web fonts API appeared to no longer be landing in WordPress 5.9. The developer was gearing up to launch a new website and service on top of the new feature. They even had a mascot. As of now, it might just have to wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature freeze deadline was two days ago. Therefore, it is unlikely the web fonts API gets added back to the WordPress 5.9 milestone. Maybe developers will see it when 6.0 lands. Maybe pushing it to the Gutenberg plugin breathes some more life into it, allowing contributors to move forward with new features that rely on it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 01:58:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WordPress.org blog: Take the 2021 WordPress Annual Survey (and view the 2020 results)!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/take-the-2021-wordpress-annual-survey-and-view-the-2020-results/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4805:\"<p>Each year, members of the WordPress community (users, site builders, extenders, and contributors) provide their valuable feedback through an annual survey.

The survey also helps leaders in the WordPress open source project learn more about our contributors’ experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that <strong><em>your</em></strong> WordPress experience is represented in the 2021 survey results, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2021-survey-english\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take the 2021 annual survey now.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-61a4d6053755b wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2021-survey-english\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Take the Annual Survey!

In the inaugural year of the survey (2015), over 50,000 responses were collected. Given the reach and adoption of WordPress, there is a significant number we have not reached. As you take the 2021 survey, consider sharing the link on social media and with other colleagues who use WordPress.

The plugin allows the platform&rsquo;s customers to sell their products directly on WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchants sign up, create products, and manage customers and subscribers using the Lemon Squeezy platform. Then they use the plugin to connect via OAuth and display products within WordPress content areas. The first version of the plugin lets users add &ldquo;buy buttons&rdquo; for products using a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For checkout, merchants can link directly to a secure hosted checkout page or show a checkout pop-up modal on their WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemon Squeezy is also aimed at WordPress product creators as the platform includes the ability to ship auto-updates for commercial themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merchants pay a monthly fee to use the service based on features, plus 3.5% + 30c per transaction. These fees cover access to the hosted platform, which handles merchant accounts, payment gateways, taxes, VAT, and other administrative details as the merchant of record. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemon Squeezy was created by veterans of the WordPress community who are looking to position the platform as a competitor to WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. In promoting the new plugin, Lemon Squeezy team member Mike McAlister, founder of Array Themes and creator of Atomic Blocks, explained why he doesn&rsquo;t see WordPress as the right tool for selling products anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;These days, I can&rsquo;t imagine running a business inside wp-admin,&rdquo; McAlister said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not built for it, in my opinion. Having sensitive customer records in the same database as site content and data stored by plugins with varying security practices just screams trouble.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemon Squeezy was met with a cautious reception from the WordPress developer community. There was some discussion on it in the Post Status Club Slack instance where members noted that the plugin launched with no migration options. This means it&rsquo;s currently only available to new store owners or those with a few products they can easily recreate. Without a straightforward migration tool, the service will have a difficult time siphoning users off of existing WordPress-based solutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the plugin is still in its early days, it seems best-suited to simple stores that don&rsquo;t require more than just being embedded on a WordPress site. In that case, there are many &ldquo;buy button&rdquo; style of e-commerce plugins with lower fees that Lemon Squeezy will be competing against as it enters the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining products on one platform and a store on a different platform may not be advantageous for some users, especially those who don&rsquo;t want to have to learn both to start selling. Lemon Squeezy&rsquo;s creators are marketing it as &ldquo;the easy-peasy way to sell digital products online,&rdquo; as the hosted service provides an attractive storefront and  takes care of all the extraneous financial details of running a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the plugin&rsquo;s name is Lemon Squeezy, its title on WordPress.org is &ldquo;<em>Easy Peasy Digital Downloads &mdash; Sell Digital Products, Subscriptions, and Licenses with Lemon Squeezy</em>.&rdquo; This seems tailored to ride on the coattails of Easy Digital Downloads&rsquo; well-established search placement as WordPress&rsquo; market leader for selling digital products. WordPress users looking to create a digital store likely would not be searching for this plugin by name unless they already knew about it from elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next on the current roadmap for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/lemon-squeezy/\">Lemon Squeezy WordPress plugin</a> is the ability to restrict content by using more features built into the Lemon Squeezy platform.

But I still feel that there is nothing like building a website from the root, with raw material: HTML, dynamic PHP, and CSS &mdash; even more now with the importance of performance and the new server-side of things.</p><p>Plus, the ability to play with dynamic data (and the database) with template tags is so smooth and efficient that it really feels like superpowers.</p><p>So, it feels a bit strange, but I&rsquo;m wondering if template tags are going to end too?</p><cite>Ricardo</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">You are asking a guy who was so nostalgic for the &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; days that he built his own custom blogging system over a weekend. And, I actually still use that same code, albeit updated and refined, for my personal blog today. When I began that project, I laid the foundation with modern PHP and build tools. However, at the heart of it, I just wanted to get back to those foundational elements of the web: HTML and CSS. I feel where you are coming from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That project was fun to build for my own edification and enjoyment, but it essentially has a user base of one. Designing the front end for it feels very much like WordPress of 10 &ndash; 15 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you said using template tags was like accessing &ldquo;superpowers,&rdquo; it brought on a wave of nostalgia of those days and weeks when I first started using them. It was such an elegant system. Anyone could grab some dynamic data by copying a code snippet and pasting it between some HTML elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with the skills or enough DIY grit, they can do anything with a little bit of code, trial-and-error, and time. However, if we are going to empower more people, developers need newer and more powerful technologies to make that possible. For WordPress development, that means embracing the block system, which seems like something you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template tags are not going away. They are just PHP functions for getting some type of data. They will be around for a long time, likely as long as WordPress itself is still kicking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many blocks actually rely on these template tags for outputting dynamic data on the front end. For example, the Archives block is literally a wrapper around <code>wp_get_archives()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer working from a code editor, you could look at blocks as modern-day template tags for WordPress. They are merely snippets of HTML code with a bit of JSON mixed in as an HTML comment. Many also display dynamic data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is really no difference between the following template tag:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php wp_get_archives() ?&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And its block equivalent:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!-- wp:archives /--&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Both spit out dynamic data. The difference is the syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, that is one of the simplest examples. Sometimes the block code is more complex. Other times, not so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes blocks more flexible is that they are built on a standardized system that empowers users to interact with them on the admin side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web development is an industry where you must continually adapt, learning new syntaxes, programming languages, libraries, technologies, and more. Just when you think you have mastered one thing, something else comes along to toss your world upside down. It can be both frustrating and fun.  Over time, you just learn to roll with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While template tags are not going away, how front-end developers build will change in the coming years. For most projects, they will work with blocks. However, block theming is in its infancy, so it is not something anyone must rush into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, the beauty of WordPress is that there is no one way of using it. If you want to build with just the <em>raw materials</em>, you can always do that. It may even make some projects easier, particularly if you have a simplified scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as performance goes, WordPress is pretty fast out of the box. Plugins and the active theme can improve its speed or make it a lot worse. Thanks to some <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/01/block-styles-loading-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/\">improvements in 5.8</a>, block styles are far more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds to me that we are kindred spirits. We appreciate the simplicity &mdash; at least what we personally view as simple &mdash; of just diving into the building blocks of the web. And, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as a professional, you are building themes for customers or performing a service for a client. The technology or the tools you use do not really matter as long as they allow you to cater to your users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe that tool is a third-party page builder on a client site. Perhaps you are building a block theme for public release on top of WordPress. Or, it could be a personal project, an itch you have been wanting to scratch. You load your code editor and begin tapping the keys. After a weekend of caffeine and junk food, you realize you have built something new and exciting from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your new project is, approach it based on what the project itself needs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 01:52:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.8.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=11546\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/11/wordpress-5-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2948:\"<p><strong>WordPress 5.8.2&nbsp;</strong>is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This security and maintenance release features <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?id=54129%2C54323%2C54207&milestone=5.8.2&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=status&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority\">2 bug</a> fixes in addition to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/54207\">1 security</a> fix.

Later, in a magazine, I read about a CMS for creating blogs that was beginning to be used to create incredible sites and which, moreover, had an international community that had created a very large documentation. Little by little, thanks to that documentation and the first sites in Italian, I started to use WordPress.</p>\n<h3>The turning point that changed my life, personally and professionally</h3>\n<p>Being an introvert by nature, I didn&#8217;t mind working from home, but I did have difficulty finding new clients and, at the same time, improving the quality of the work I was doing using WordPress, which had become the only CMS I was using to create sites.</p>\n<p>The discovery was to look at the dashboard and notice a label where it was written Events and news on WordPress, inside which were reported events among which one immediately caught my attention: the WordPress meetup in Rome.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The turning point was in November 2017 when I went, with great curiosity, to the first meeting of the WordPress Meetup in Rome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I must admit that the impact was not at all easy since the first talk I listened to then, was about WP-CLI, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/\">command line interface for WordPress</a>, and, for someone like me, who had done simple jobs and certainly not as a developer, it was a real trauma: I wondered if I was really suitable for this environment. Then, at the end of the meeting, someone mentioned WordCamp Rome 2017.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCamp</h3>\n<p>I tried to find out about this event and I found it difficult to understand how it worked: it was two days but, while I had read for the second day that it was going to be a day of talks, I had no idea what was going on during the first day. So I decided to write an email for information. The person who wrote back explained that it was a contributor day, a day called Contributor Day, and</p>\n<blockquote><p>in the end I chose not to participate because I thought to myself, &#8220;What can I do? I don&#8217;t know anything about WordPress&#8221;&#8230; a big mistake, which I later reflected on and understood.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The WordCamp was a great discovery: talks at all levels, from basic (suitable for me) to those for developers, even advanced or very advanced. I was immediately struck by the enthusiasm of the volunteers and the environment where I felt very comfortable, so much so that I asked myself how I could participate in some WordCamps. Asking around I was immediately informed about the possibility of applying as a volunteer.</p>\n<p>During the WordCamp I heard about Slack; I didn&#8217;t understand much about it, even if everyone encouraged me to sign up to join the WordPress community, but the doubt I had was always the same: what could my contribution be?</p>\n<h3>Slack and the choice to join the Polyglots</h3>\n<p>Once on Slack, the choice of where to go was simple: not being a developer, I opted for the Polyglots (the volunteers who <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">translate the whole WordPress ecosystem into the various languages</a>) starting with the translation of a theme I was using for my work at the time. Little by little I got interested in the plugin activities, attending all the meetings and offering myself as a translator for themes and plugins: now I&#8217;m a GTE (General Translation Editor) and I also take care of the WordPress Core translations.</p>\n<p>Participating in Slack has helped me enormously: I&#8217;ve met a lot of people who I now call friends. Moreover, by translating, I learned a lot about how themes and plugins work.</p>\n<p>As my work with Polyglots has grown, it has led me to join other teams, the latest of which is the group of translators for Helphub, the new official WordPress documentation system.</p>\n<h3>WordCamps</h3>\n<p>After WordCamp Rome 2017, I started volunteering starting with WordCamp Rome 2018; there I participated in the first Contributor Day where I could actively contribute as a translator. Since that WordCamp, given my passion for photography, I volunteered as a photographer for many other events in Italy organized by the WordPress community, and I must say that this commitment to the community also allows me to have fun: being a photographer means having the opportunity to walk around the halls and capture moments of the life of a WordCamp.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Participating in WordCamps has made me so passionate about it that I must admit I have been in crisis due to the lack of events during the pandemic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A friend of mine, a WordCamp fanatic like me, once said to me: &#8220;Stefano, there&#8217;s nothing to do, we have to admit that we are WordCamp addicts: the more you attend, the more you want to go to other WordCamps&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>The WordPress Meetup in Rome and the pandemic</h3>\n<p>In October 2019 I was asked to become the organizer of the WordPress meetup in Rome; at the beginning there was the difficulty of finding the place to organize the meetings since the agreement with the coworking that was previously available was broken, but COVID made sure that the event didn&#8217;t take place at all. The new challenge was therefore the organisation of online events, and, to be honest, I had fun as I had the pleasure of contacting many friends of the community who willingly offered to be speakers for the meetup in Rome with always interesting talks.</p>\n<h3>The WordCamp Italy</h3>\n<p>COVID led to the deleting of Meetups and WordCamps. Fortunately, the Italian WordPress community didn&#8217;t give up and organised the WordCamp Italia online, which brought together the organisers of previous meetups and WordCamps, as well as new people like me with no experience of organising events. I took part in both editions as a member of the social &amp; communication team, where I took care of the social channels and website content together with the other two organisers who were part of the team, and the experience made me grow professionally because I worked with the best that could be among the members of the community.</p>\n<h3>Working together with community members</h3>\n<p>The best thing I got out of joining the WordPress community was the chance to collaborate with some people on a working basis and, I have to say, that was incredible. Being with many of them you have an incredible opportunity to grow in knowledge, you just have to be ready to learn&#8230; and with WordPress you never stop learning, there is always something new that is suggested to you by those who have more experience than you.</p>\n<h3>What did WordPress bring me?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Discovering the community: WordPress introduced me to the world of its community, both Italian and international; the WordPress community connects WordPress enthusiasts through monthly Meetups, annual WordCamps, virtual collaborations such as contributions to the WordPress project, and much more.</li>\n<li>Professional growth: the chance to work, but also the chance to learn more and more about its ecosystem</li>\n<li>Personal growth: WordPress and the community have helped my confidence and self-esteem; I still have the &#8220;impostor syndrome&#8221; and I fear it will never go away, as I always question all my choices (and often prefer to avoid exposing myself), but being in the community has helped me overcome many fears and fears, such as feeling eligible to apply for some position in WordPress companies, which I would NEVER have thought of doing before.</li>\n<li>Friends: Being in the community has made me discover that there are people like me who share the same thoughts about work and who are always nice to talk to, and I must admit that we could talk for hours because we always find topics to talk about. In the community I have discovered friends with whom I have formed an incredible bond, people who are always ready to stimulate and support, and give help when you are in difficulty &#8230; and this is a common feature of many communities that gravitate around the world of WordPress!!!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What can I recommend?</h3>\n<p>Join your local meetup or think about organising one, it will introduce you to an amazing world. Don&#8217;t be afraid to meet people at WordCamps and Contributor Days, because you will learn more there than in dozens of courses. Talk to people at those events and don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;re people like you doing the same job as you and remember, the WordPress community is inclusive so you&#8217;ll always feel welcome, and you&#8217;ll see enthusiasm like you&#8217;ve never seen at other IT events.</p>\n<p>One last recommendation: sign up for Slack and join the local WordPress community.</p>\n<h1 id=\"italian\">Contribuire a WordPress senza essere uno sviluppatore</h1>\n<h3>Gli inizi provando vari CMS</h3>\n<p>Sono sempre stato affascinato da internet, mi ricordo quando negli anni ‘90 andavo con gli amici in pub dove potevamo utilizzare un computer e capire come erano strutturati i siti web come quello dell’FBI, oppure apprendendo l’utilizzo degli antenati delle attuali chat come, ad esempio, mIRC.</p>\n<p>Ho iniziato a creare siti internet nel 1998 per gioco, e il mio primo lavoro pagato è stato per il negozio presso il quale acquistavo i fumetti..</p>\n<p>Poco alla volta mi sono avvicinato ai CMS per velocizzare la creazione dei siti: ho provato Joomla e Drupal e non mi hanno mai soddisfatto appieno a causa della scarsità di guide. Successivamente, su una rivista, lessi di un CMS per la creazione di blog che iniziava a essere utilizzato per realizzare siti incredibili e che, inoltre, aveva una community internazionale che aveva creato una documentazione molto vasta. Poco alla volta, grazie a quella documentazione e ai primi siti in italiano, ho iniziato a utilizzare WordPress.</p>\n<h3>La svolta che ha cambiato la mia vita, personale e professionale</h3>\n<p>Essendo un introverso di natura, non mi dispiaceva lavorare da casa, andando incontro, però, alla difficoltà di trovare nuovi clienti e, al contempo, migliorare la qualità del lavoro che veniva da me svolta utilizzando WordPress, che era diventato, nel frattempo, l’unico CMS che utilizzavo per realizzare siti.</p>\n<p>La scoperta fu quella di osservare la bacheca e notare una etichetta dove era scritto <strong>Eventi e notizie su WordPress</strong>, al cui interno erano segnalati degli eventi tra i quali uno colpì immediatamente la mia attenzione: il meetup WordPress di Roma.</p>\n<blockquote><p>La svolta fu a novembre del 2017 quando mi sono recato, con molta curiosità, al primo incontro del Meetup WordPress di Roma.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Devo ammettere che l’impatto non fu affatto facile visto che il primo talk che ascoltai allora, parlava di WP-CLI, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/guides/installing/\">una interfaccia da linea di comando per WordPress</a>, e, per uno come me, che aveva svolto lavori semplici e non certamente come sviluppatore, fu un vero e proprio trauma: mi domandavo se fossi davvero adatto a questo ambiente. Poi, a chiusura dell’incontro, qualcuno accennò al WordCamp Roma 2017.</p>\n<h3>Il mio primo WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Cercai di informarmi su questo evento e mi risultava difficile capire come funzionasse: erano due giorni ma, mentre per il secondo giorno avevo letto che sarebbe stata una giornata dedicata ai talk, non avevo la minima idea di cosa si facesse durante il primo giorno. Così decisi e scrissi una email per avere informazioni. Chi mi rispose mi spiegò che si trattava di una giornata dedicata alla contribuzione, una giornata chiamata “Contributor Day” e,</p>\n<blockquote><p>alla fine, scelsi di non partecipare perché, tra me e me, pensavo: dicevo “Ma io che posso fare? Non so niente di WordPress”&#8230; un grave errore, sul quale ho poi riflettuto e compreso.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Il WordCamp è stata una grandissima una scoperta: talk di tutti i livelli, da quelli base (adatti a me) a quelli per sviluppatori, anche avanzati o avanzatissimi. Mi ha colpito da subito l’entusiasmo dei volontari e l’ambiente dove mi trovavo benissimo, tanto da chiedermi come fare per partecipare a qualche WordCamp. Chiedendo informazioni in giro fui subito informato della possibilità di candidarsi come volontario.</p>\n<p>Durante il WordCamp sentivo parlare di Slack; capivo poco di cosa si trattasse anche se tutti mi incoraggiavano ad iscriversi per unirsi alla community di WordPress, ma il dubbio che mi attanagliava era sempre lo stesso: quale poteva essere il mio contributo?</p>\n<h3>Slack e la scelta di unirmi ai Polyglots</h3>\n<p>Arrivato su Slack, la scelta su dove andare è stata semplice: non essendo uno sviluppatore, ho optato per i Polyglots (i volontari che si occupano di <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/traduzioni/\">tradurre tutto l’ecosistema WordPress</a> nelle varie lingue) partendo dalla traduzione di un tema che utilizzavo per il mio lavoro in quel periodo. Poco alla volta mi sono appassionato alle attività dei plugin partecipando a tutte le riunioni ed offrendomi come traduttore per temi e plugin: adesso sono un GTE (General Translation Editor) e mi occupo anche delle traduzioni in italiano del Core di WordPress.</p>\n<p>La partecipazione a Slack mi ha aiutato enormemente: ho conosciuto tantissime persone che ormai definisco amici. Inoltre, traducendo, ho imparato tantissimo su come funzionano temi e plugin.</p>\n<p>La mia attività con i Polyglots, man mano che è cresciuto il mio impegno, mi ha portato ad unirmi ad altri team, ultimo dei quali è il gruppo dei traduttori di Helphub, il nuovo sistema ufficiale per la documentazione di WordPress.</p>\n<h3>I WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Dopo il WordCamp Roma 2017, ho iniziato a fare il volontario partendo dal WordCamp Roma 2018; lì ho partecipato al primo Contributor Day dove ho potuto contribuire attivamente come traduttore. A partire da quel WordCamp, vista la mia passione per la fotografia, mi sono offerto come volontario fotografo per molti altri eventi in Italia organizzati dalla community di WordPress e devo dire che questo impegno per la community, mi permette anche di divertirmi: essere fotografo vuol dire avere la possibilità di girare per le sale ed immortalare attimi della vita di un WordCamp.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Partecipare ai WordCamp mi ha appassionato tantissimo, tanto che devo ammettere di essere andato in crisi per mancanza di eventi durante la pandemia.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Un amico, fanatico di WordCamp come me, mi ha detto una volta: “Stefano, non c’è niente da fare, dobbiamo ammettere di essere dei drogati di WordCamp: più partecipi, più ti viene voglia di frequentarne altri”.</p>\n<h3>Il Meetup WordPress di Roma e la pandemia</h3>\n<p>Nell’ottobre del 2019 mi è stato chiesto di diventare organizzatore del meetup WordPress di Roma; all’inizio c’era la difficoltà di trovare il posto dove organizzare gli incontri visto che era saltato l’accordo con il coworking che dava in precedenza la disponibilità, ma il COVID ha fatto in modo che l’evento non si svolgesse del tutto. La nuova sfida è stata perciò l’organizzazione di eventi online, e, a dirla tutta, mi sono divertito avendo avuto il piacere di contattare tanti amici della community che si sono offerti volentieri di essere speaker per il meetup di Roma con talk sempre interessanti.</p>\n<h3>Il WordCamp Italia</h3>\n<p>Il COVID ha portato all’annullamento degli incontri dei Meetup e dei WordCamp. Fortunatamente la community italiana di WordPress non si è arresa ed ha organizzato il WordCamp Italia online, che ha messo assieme gli organizzatori di meetup e WordCamp precedenti, oltre a gente nuova come me a digiuno completo di esperienza di organizzazione di eventi. Ho partecipato a entrambe le edizioni come componente del team social &amp; comunicazione, dove mi sono occupato dei canali social e dei contenuti del sito insieme con gli altri due organizzatori che facevano parte del team, e l’esperienza mi ha fatto crescere dal punto di vista professionale perché ho lavorato con il meglio che ci poteva essere tra i membri della community.</p>\n<h3>Il lavoro insieme ai membri della community</h3>\n<p>Il risultato migliore che ho ottenuto entrando nella community di WordPress è stata la possibilità di collaborare con alcune persone anche lavorativamente e, devo dire, che è stato incredibile. Stando con molti di loro si ha una incredibile possibilità di crescita nelle conoscenze, basta essere sempre pronti a imparare… e con WordPress non si finisce mai di imparare, c’è sempre qualcosa di nuovo che ti viene suggerito da chi ha più esperienza di te</p>\n<h3>Che cosa mi ha portato WordPress?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Scoprire la community: WordPress mi ha introdotto al mondo della sua comunità, sia italiana che internazionale; la community di WordPress collega gli appassionati di WordPress tramite Meetup mensili, WordCamp annuali, collaborazioni virtuali come i contributi al progetto WordPress, e molto altro ancora.</li>\n<li>Crescita professionale: la possibilità di lavorare, ma anche la possibilità di conoscere sempre più aspetti del suo ecosistema</li>\n<li>Crescita personale: WordPress e la community mi hanno aiutato nella sicurezza e nell’autostima; ancora adesso c’è in me la “sindrome dell’impostore” e temo che non se ne andrà mai via, dato che metto sempre in dubbio tutte le mie scelte (e spesso preferisco evitare di espormi), ma frequentare la community mi ha fatto vincere molte paure e timori, come sentirmi idoneo a candidarmi per una qualche posizione in aziende nell’ambito WordPress, cosa che, precedentemente, MAI avrei pensato di fare.</li>\n<li>Gli amici e le amiche: frequentare la community mi ha fatto scoprire che ci sono persone come me che condividono i miei stessi pensieri sul lavoro e con i quali è sempre piacevole poter parlare, e devo ammettere che potremmo discutere per ore perché troviamo sempre argomenti di cui parlare. Nella community ho scoperto amici e amiche con i quali si è creato un legame incredibile, persone che sono sempre pronte a stimolare e supportare, e dare un aiuto quando si è in difficoltà… e questa è una caratteristica comune a molte community che gravitano attorno al mondo di WordPress!!!</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cosa consigliare?</h3>\n<p>Partecipate al meetup della vostra città o pensate organizzarne uno, vi farà entrare in un mondo incredibile. Non abbiate paura di incontrare le persone ai WordCamp e partecipare ai Contributor Day, perché imparerete più lì che in decine di corsi. Parlate con chi partecipa a quegli eventi e non preoccupatevi, sono persone come voi che fanno il vostro stesso lavoro e ricordatevi, la community di WordPress è inclusiva per cui vi sentirete sempre ben accetti, e vedrete un entusiasmo come non avete mai visto in altri eventi di informatica.</p>\n<p>Una ultima raccomandazione: iscrivetevi a <a href=\"https://it.wordpress.org/slack/\">Slack</a> ed unitevi alla community locale di WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 07:00:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Stefano Cassone\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Radio Station PRO Launches, Offers New Tools for Live Broadcasters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125089\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:195:\"https://wptavern.com/radio-station-pro-launches-offers-new-tools-for-live-broadcasters?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=radio-station-pro-launches-offers-new-tools-for-live-broadcasters\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8174:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In June, netmix&reg; CEO Tony Zeoli <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/radio-station-pro-is-just-around-the-corner/\">began touting</a> the release of the company&rsquo;s Radio Station PRO plugin. It would offer an upgraded experience over the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/radio-station\">free version</a> his team had maintained since 2019. At the end of last month, the company officially <a href=\"https://radiostation.pro/radio-station-pro-press-release-oct-21-2021/\">launched its commercial offering</a>, a plan that had been in the works since the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial plugin was built for live audio broadcasters with a rolling show schedule. Its audience ranges from radio stations to live streamers to Clubhouse moderators. It allows listeners to browse generated show and team pages, playlists, and related information uninterrupted during a live stream. The goal is to create a more efficient scheduling and streaming system, saving broadcasters time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nikki Blight created the original Radio Station plugin but had stopped working on it in 2015. Zeoli adopted it in 2019 and picked up <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majick/\">Tony Hayes</a> to handle its development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When I first stumbled onto Radio Station at WPVM, I saw the potential for broadcasters wrapped up in one free plugin that had been orphaned,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;It just needed someone who could re-commit to it and bring it back to life. And it would surely help if they had an interest in streaming radio and broadcasting, which the other Tony and I both do. I don&rsquo;t think just anyone could have taken it over. It had to be someone with a passion and interest in the space.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two did not launch with a free product. However, Zeoli said he realized the potential for a commercial version quickly after taking over the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pro-plugin-upgrades\">PRO Plugin Upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Table view of schedule and player from <a href=\"https://demo.radiostation.pro/\">Radio Station PRO demo</a>.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The team had several features they had wanted to improve over the free version. The first order of business was improving the scheduling experience. For the free plugin, the team created a conflict catcher. However, they built a front-end visual schedule editor for the commercial version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Another issue we needed to resolve was the audio player experience,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;Radio Station free has a simple audio player widget that we created earlier this year. What really sets the PRO version apart here is the addition of a persistent (or &lsquo;sticky&rsquo;) header or footer player, so when the listener navigates the website while the stream is activated, playback is not interrupted.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hayes created a second plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/teleporter/\">Teleporter</a> to handle the persistent player. The free, WordPress.org-hosted extension is baked into Radio Station PRO, but it is open for other developers in their applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also tried to tackle time zone issues in the global broadcasting world. PRO adds a switcher to help visitors set the schedule to their preferred time zone instead of performing &ldquo;brain gymnastics,&rdquo; as Zeoli joked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&rsquo;s widgets automatically refresh and dynamically display data, such as the next song in a playlist or a show title change. The hope is to bring this technology to the block world, but it must wait until next year. Zeoli said there is not a rush because most of their users are not there yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has added a new episodes post type alongside the plugin&rsquo;s original shows and playlists. Eventually, they plan to allow broadcasters to further break that down into segments. Radio Station PRO tacks on host and producer profile pages. It also has a built-in role manager, extended scheduling period, and additional layout views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the toughest competition in the space is against the commercial theme market. There are several live-broadcasting themes, but Zeoli says these can be both cost-prohibitive in the long term and lock users into a design that users may not want in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With so much data going into the Post Types, you really don&rsquo;t want to leave that in a theme if you want to switch for some reason,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unlike SEO plugins, there are no conversion plugins for radio station themes or plugins, so it could pose a problem by being locked into a theme as opposed to having the flexibility of a theme-agnostic plugin.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover alignfull has-parallax\"><span class=\"has-gray-900-background-color has-background-dim-70 wp-block-cover__gradient-background has-background-dim bg-gray-900\"></span><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center has-titanic-font-size text-5xl text-center\" id=\"from-boston-to-asheville-a-lifetime-of-radio\">From Boston to Asheville: A Lifetime of Radio</h2>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m originally from Boston, where my interest in radio evolved at an early age into a career as a nightclub and mix show DJ,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;I listened to the radio all the time; news, talk, sports, and music, I was into it all. As I got older, I tuned in to college radio, and, as a senior in high school, I got the chance to intern at a local AM station and did guest mix sets on the largest commercial station, KISS 108.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He completed a two-year degree in Radio and Television broadcasting at a small school outside New York City. Then, returned home to Boston with a focus on DJing while working at record stores. He later moved on to work at a record label and DJ remix service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It was the early days of the World Wide Web,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;And I saw the opportunity to marry my passion for DJing with streaming media and launched my first startup, netmix.com, which was the earliest effort to stream DJ sets from popular electronic music and hip-hop DJs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He moved netmix&reg; to New York City, and the company was acquired by Polyverse, Inc in 2000. The company ceased operations during the dot-com crash, but Zeoli retained the domain name for 19 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After bouncing between various corporations and startups, he dove deeper into WordPress. He had stumbled upon it while working on a project for the Associated Press in 2003.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That led to launching Digital Strategy Works, a WordPress and digital strategy agency (which I still run today), founding the WordPress Westchester Meetup, and presenting at early WordCamps in NYC and Raleigh, NC.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A chance encounter in Raleigh landed him a WordPress-specific job at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Some work at a large corporation followed, and he finally migrated to Asheville, NC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I got back into radio to re-engage in and merge my love of broadcasting with DJing with a new mix show, the Asheville House Music Society,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;I was certainly getting back in the groove of broadcasting and streaming.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spring of 2019, he had been helping with the <a href=\"https://wpvmfm.org/\">WPVM</a> website, which was using the original Radio Station plugin. He contacted Blight, the owner, after finding a theme conflict. He soon adopted the project, found a partner in Hayes, and had a new use for his decades-old domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I just thought it was a very useful plugin and could see the groundbreaking potential for radio stations that really needed a comprehensive set of WordPress tools to help them publish search engine optimized content on their WordPress websites, but in a way that fit the station schedule formatting,&rdquo; said Zeoli. &ldquo;I figured, given my decades-long interest in and experience with streaming and broadcasting when combined with my agile product development experience, I could find a way to keep it going.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 22:43:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WPTavern: New Block Plugin Displays Post Formats\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125453\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:141:\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-plugin-displays-post-formats?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-block-plugin-displays-post-formats\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3024:\"<p>Are you using post formats? Now there&rsquo;s a block for that! WordPress&rsquo; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-formats/\">post formats</a> feature was introduced in version 3.1 as a way for themes to customize presentation of a post. It allows users to choose the way a post looks by selecting a post format from a dropdown list. WordPress has a fixed list of post formats available but not all themes support them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post formats have maintained a smaller cult following. While I don&rsquo;t see them making a major comeback, many users who committed to using them long ago would like to continue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Core Committer Aaron Jorbin has created a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-format-block/\">Post Format Block</a> that will display a post format in a block-based theme. His <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/introducing-post-format-block/\">writeup</a> dives deeper into the technical details of how he created the plugin. The block allows users to change the color, font size and weight of the displayed post format. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Post Format Block plugin</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorbin said he built the plugin to display post formats on his personal site and wanted to help others do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As someone that benefits greatly from Open Source, I view it as my responsibility to give back and it wasn&rsquo;t much effort to build it in a way that it could be open from the start,&rdquo; Jorbin said. &ldquo;Plus it gave me a chance to play with codespaces and explore some parts of Gutenberg I wasn&rsquo;t as familiar with.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are post formats relevant in the new frontier of blocks, where users have more control over the presentation of posts than ever before? They may not have a strong future in WordPress moving forward, but thanks to the plugin system, people can keep using them while using a block-based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think Post Formats are in a weird position since looking back with hind sight, I don&rsquo;t think they should have been a part of core,&rdquo; Jorbin said. &ldquo;But for now, they remain in core and they are useful for me in this instance. I like them since for my personal site, they make sense. But I don&rsquo;t think they make sense on a lot of sites.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using post formats and you want to be able to keep using them with a block-based theme, this plugin will give you that continuity. You will want to search for it using the name of it in quotes.

Since that time the Polyglots team has grown to include the work of 55,427&nbsp;translation contributors. They have also  adopted more efficient tools like P2 and Slack to stay connected, but some translators find it difficult to follow the constant stream of posts and meetings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monthly newsletter was launched to provide a short-format digest of all the significant happenings and discussions in the translation community. It will include news related to upcoming releases and Polyglots tools, condensed so contributors don&rsquo;t have to keep a close eye on the team&rsquo;s P2 blog, Slack channels, or RSS feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first edition features a brief summary of the month-long WordPress Translation Day 2021 event, which brought in 697 new translation contributors. Altogether the contributor teams submitted 518,710 approved translation strings during 22 local and six livestream events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of people using WordPress are using it with a translation. As of October 2021, 55.36% of WordPress sites are running a translated site. That figure is slowly inching upward as WordPress adoption grows in the non-English speaking world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">WordPress Locales</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not a member of the Polyglots team, this newsletter is a good way to stay up-to-date with the exciting frontier of WordPress translations.

In November 2020, he <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/26905\">opened a ticket</a> on the Gutenberg GitHub repository to explore an overlay-based approach to viewing, searching, and inserting patterns into the content canvas. Late last week, a pull request for the long-awaited feature <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35773\">landed in the Gutenberg plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, patterns were a new concept for the average WordPress user. WordPress 5.5 introduced them to the world, and we were only a month out from the next major release. I had hoped we could plug the new overlay in as soon as possible, but sometimes an idea needs time or the right people working on it to give it that necessary push.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first iteration of the pattern explorer will likely be a baseline experience that can be built upon in the future. Currently, users can search via the modal or filter by category (includes featured patterns in the list).</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Pattern explorer modal.\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, the explorer should offer more features. An <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35006#issuecomment-929605688\">earlier mockup</a> of it showed user favorites by connecting with a WordPress.org account. This sat alongside featured and newest-pattern lists. The mockup also had a separate section for template part patterns, such as header, footer, and sidebar. With the WordPress 5.9 feature freeze coming on November 9, those extras will likely need to wait until a future release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To access the explorer overlay, users will need to click the &ldquo;Explore&rdquo; button when viewing patterns in the inserter. It then pops up a full-screen overlay for navigating them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />&ldquo;Explore&rdquo; button next to the pattern category dropdown.\n\n\n\n<p>This type of pattern navigation experience has already become a necessity. The narrow inserter has not held up well against themes that ship a lot of patterns, such as the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tove-a-block-based-wordpress-theme-by-anders-noren\">40+ bundled with Tove</a>. The problem will only grow exponentially worse as the pattern directory is opened to more submissions and other themes inevitably add dozens upon dozens of their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience is much nicer now. However, it still has a few wrinkles that need to be ironed out. Several patterns have scrollbars of their own within the explorer. As Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/35773#issuecomment-948737083\">noted in the ticket</a>, it makes the &ldquo;experience very janky.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Patterns with scrollbars.\n\n\n\n<p>In my tests, the patterns butted against the explorer sidebar on the left. Fixing this should not take much work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than once, I also ran into the dreaded &ldquo;Aw, Snap!&rdquo; browser error message after viewing the explorer&rsquo;s patterns. The error code: <em>out of memory.</em>  This happened when running a clean install alongside the Twenty Twenty-Two WordPress theme. I can only hope it is a non-issue when WordPress 5.9 rolls around and is live on production sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, I want to see a quicker method for accessing this pattern modal. I am leaning toward a dedicated button in the toolbar for pulling up the overlay. Right now, it takes three mouse clicks to open it. First, users must click the &ldquo;+&rdquo; inserter button. Then, they must switch to the Patterns tab before hitting the Explore button. That is a lot of work for something that should be a first-class feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A keyboard shortcut would also be a welcome access point. I could live with that compromise if the development team is not yet ready to stick another item at the top level of the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I am happy with this upcoming feature. I may even try my hand at building some new ones. Those I had been tinkering with in my custom theme had become so unwieldy that testing them was a headache. This will open things up and should make it a lot more enjoyable to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg plugin users should see this land in version 11.9 later this week. It is also currently available in the trunk branch of WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Nov 2021 00:38:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"Gutenberg Times: Life-improving development tools and Theme Revolution – Weekend Edition 192\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=19522\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/life-improving-development-tools-and-theme-revolution-weekend-edition-192/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22219:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the US, November is the month of gratitude and a time of reflection and to  counts one&#8217;s blessings.

Ben Galbraith fielded the question, saying he could not comment on the AMP-related legal proceedings but focused on the Privacy Sandbox: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I think it&rsquo;s important to note that we&rsquo;re not asking for blind trust with the Sandbox effort. Instead, we&rsquo;re working in the open, which means that we&rsquo;re sharing our ideas while they are in an early phase. We&rsquo;re sharing specific API proposals, and then we&rsquo;re sharing our code out in the open and running experiments in the open. In this process we&rsquo;re also working really closely with industry regulators. You may have seen the agreement that we announced earlier this year jointly with the UK&rsquo;s CMA, and we have a bunch of industry collaborators with us. We&rsquo;ll continue to be very transparent moving forward, both in terms of how the Sandbox works and its resulting privacy properties. We expect the effort will be judged on that basis.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>FLoC continues to be a controversial initiative, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants\">opposed by many major tech organizations</a>. A group of like-minded WordPress contributors <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-propose-blocking-floc-in-core\">proposed blocking Google&rsquo;s initiative</a> earlier this year. Privacy advocates do not believe FLoC to be a compelling alternative to the surveillance business model currently used by the advertising industry. Instead, they see it as an invitation to cede more control of ad tech to Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Galbraith&rsquo;s statement conflicts with the company&rsquo;s actions earlier this year when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-concludes-floc-origin-trial-does-not-intend-to-share-feedback-from-participants\">Google said the team does not intend to disclose any of the private feedback</a>&nbsp;received during FLoC&rsquo;s origin trial, which was criticized as a lack of transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the developer community&rsquo;s waning trust in the company, Google continues to aggressively advocate for a number of controversial initiatives, even after some of them have landed the company in legal trouble. Google employees are not permitted to talk about the antitrust lawsuit and seem eager to distance themselves from the proceedings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeremy Keith&rsquo;s question referencing the AMP allegations in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/unredacted-antitrust-complaint-unsealed-google-internal-documents-show-amp-pages-brought-40-less-revenue-to-publishers\">recently unredacted antitrust complaint against Google</a> was extremely unlikely to receive an adequate response from the Chrome Leadership team, but the mere act of asking is a public reminder of the trust Google has willfully eroded in pushing AMP on publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/06/google-receives-demand-documents-doj-acknowledging-federal-antitrust-scrutiny/\">Google received a demand for a trove of documents</a> from the Department of Justice as part of the pre-trial process, the company was reluctant to hand them over. These documents reveal how Google identified header bidding as an &ldquo;existential threat&rdquo; and detail how AMP was used as a tool to impede header bidding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complaint alleges that <em>&ldquo;Google ad server employees met with AMP employees to strategize about using AMP to impede header bidding, addressing in particular how much pressure publishers and advertisers would tolerate.&rdquo;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, it claims that Google falsely told publishers that adopting AMP would enhance load times, even though the company&rsquo;s employees knew that it only improved the &ldquo;median of performance&rdquo; and actually loaded slower than some speed optimization techniques publishers had been using. It alleges that AMP pages brought 40% less revenue to publishers. The complaint states that AMP&rsquo;s speed benefits &ldquo;were also at least partly a result of Google&rsquo;s throttling.&nbsp;<strong>Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a &lsquo;nice comparative boost.</strong>&lsquo;&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the internal documents were not published alongside the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903/gov.uscourts.nysd.564903.152.0_1.pdf\">unredacted complaint</a>, these are heavy claims for the Department of Justice to float against Google if the documents didn&rsquo;t fully substantiate them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AMP-related allegations are egregious and demand a truly transparent answer. We all watched as Google used its weight to force publishers both small and large to adopt its framework or forego mobile traffic and placement in the Top Stories carousel. This came at an enormous cost to publishers who were unwilling to adopt AMP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barry Adams, one of the most vocal <a href=\"https://www.polemicdigital.com/google-amp-go-to-hell/\">critics of the AMP project</a>, demonstrated this cost to publishers in a graph that shows the percentage of articles in Google&rsquo;s mobile Top Stories carousel in the US that are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;AMP articles. When Google stopped requiring AMP for the mobile Top Stories in July 2021, there was a sharp spike in non-AMP URLs being included.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Once AMP was no longer required and publishers could use any technology to rank in Top Stories, the percentage of non-AMP pages increased significantly to double digits, <a href=\"https://www.newzdash.com/guide/amp-tracker\">where it remains today</a>. Adams&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.seoforgooglenews.com/p/lets-talk-about-amp\">article</a> calls on the web community to recognize the damage Google did in giving AMP pages preferential treatment:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m angry. Because it means that for more than&nbsp;<strong>five long years</strong>, when AMP was a mobile Top Stories requirement, Google <strong>penalised</strong>&nbsp;these publishers for not using AMP.</p><p>There was&nbsp;<strong>no other reason</strong>&nbsp;for Google to stop ranking these publishers in their mobile Top Stories carousel. As is evident from the surge of non-AMP articles, there are likely hundreds &ndash; if not thousands &ndash; of publishers who&nbsp;<strong>ticked every single ranking box</strong>&nbsp;that Google demanded; quality news content, easily crawlable and indexable technology stack, good editorial authority signals, and so on.</p><p>But they didn&rsquo;t use AMP. So Google didn&rsquo;t rank them. Think for a moment about the cost of that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the publishers who adopted AMP struggled to get ad views. In 2017, Digiday reported on how many publishers have experienced&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-find-google-amp-loads-fast-ad-views/\" target=\"_blank\">decreased revenues associated with ads loading much slower than the actual content</a>. I don&rsquo;t think anyone at the time imagined that Google was throttling the non-AMP ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The aim of AMP is to load content first and ads second,&rdquo; a Google spokesperson told Digiday. &ldquo;But we are working on making ads faster. It takes quite a bit of the ecosystem to get on board with the notion that speed is important for ads, just as it is for content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why Google is rapidly losing publishers&rsquo; trust. For years the company encumbered already struggling news organizations with the requirement of AMP. The DOJ&rsquo;s detailed description of how AMP was used as a vehicle for anticompetitive practices simply rubs salt in the wound after what publishers have been through in expending resources to support AMP versions of their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"automattic-denies-prior-knowledge-of-google-throttling-non-amp-ads\">Automattic Denies Prior Knowledge of Google Throttling Non-Amp Ads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Automattic, one of the most influential companies in the WordPress ecosystem, partnered with Google to promote AMP as an early adopter. WordPress.com added AMP support and Automattic built the first versions of the AMP plugin for self-hosted WordPress sites. The company has played a significant role in driving AMP adoption forward, giving it an entrance into the WordPress ecosystem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much did Automattic know when it partnered with Google in the initial AMP rollout? I asked the company what the precise nature of its relationship with Google is regarding AMP at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As part of our mission to make the web a better place, we are always testing new technologies including AMP,&rdquo; an official spokesperson for Automattic said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may be true but Automattic has done more than simply test the new technology. In partnering with Google, it has been instrumental in making AMP easier for WordPress users to adopt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We received no funds from Google for the project,&rdquo; a spokesperson for Automattic said when asked if the company was compensated as a partner in this effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did Google promise Automattic to convince the company to become an early partner in the AMP rollout? I asked if the company has an official response to the allegations that Google was throttling the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP &ldquo;a nice comparative boost.&rdquo; The spokesperson would not respond to the specific claims but indicated the company did not have prior knowledge of any actions that might not be above board:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We chose to partner with Google because we believed that we had a shared vision of advancing the open web. Additionally, we wanted to offer the benefit of the latest technology to WordPress users and publishers including AMP.</p><p>While we aren&rsquo;t able to comment on legal matters in progress, we can say that over the course of our partnership, we were not aware of any actions that did not align with our company&rsquo;s mission to support the open web and make it a better place.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The antitrust complaint also details a Project NERA, which was designed to &ldquo;successfully mimic a walled garden across the open web.&rdquo; When asked about this, Automattic reiterated its commitment to supporting the open web and gave the same response: &ldquo;We were not aware of any actions that did not align with our company&rsquo;s mission.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In examining the weight of the DOJ&rsquo;s allegations, it&rsquo;s important to consider how this impacts WordPress as a CMS that is used by 42% of the web.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yoast-and-google-sponsored-core-contributors-propose-new-wordpress-performance-team\">A new performance team for WordPress core</a> is being spearheaded by Yoast and Google-sponsored employees. The initial proposal is to improve core performance as measured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.dev/vitals/\">Google&rsquo;s Core Web Vitals</a>&nbsp;metrics. These metrics are a set of specific factors that Google deems important for user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without questioning the personal integrity of the contributors on that team, I think it&rsquo;s important that Google leadership acknowledge how AMP has damaged publishers&rsquo; trust in light of recent events. Many of these contributors are heavily involved in building AMP-related resources for the WordPress ecosystem. Are their contributions purely aimed at making WordPress core more performant or is there a long game that serves Google&rsquo;s interests being woven into this initiative? Would these employees even be aware of it if there were?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are important considerations if Google defines the performance metrics WordPress is measuring against. The company&rsquo;s alleged misdeeds seem to be buried high up in the command chain. Those tasked with peddling AMP may have had no knowledge of the alleged anticompetitive practices identified by the DOJ in Google&rsquo;s internal documents. The WordPress community should continue to be vigilant on behalf of publishers who depend on WordPress to remain an unadulterated advocate for the open web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 06 Nov 2021 03:40:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"WPTavern: Patchstack Releases Free Security Plugin, Its Red Team Found 1,182 Vulnerabilities Since March\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=125147\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:259:\"https://wptavern.com/patchstack-releases-free-security-plugin-its-red-team-found-over-1182-vulnerabilities-since-march?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=patchstack-releases-free-security-plugin-its-red-team-found-over-1182-vulnerabilities-since-march\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5249:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In September, Patchstack released its <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/patchstack-red-team-report-1067-vulnerabilities-7700-in-rewards/\">six-month report</a> on the vulnerabilities found with WordPress and its extensions. At the time, it listed over 1,000 issues &mdash; the company has shared the updated numbers with WP Tavern. It soon followed that up with a free vulnerability-reporting plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the banner of WebARX, the company launched the first version of its security platform in 2018. After growing beyond its original SaaS offering with services like its PlugBounty and acquisition of ThreatPress, the company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webarx-rebrands-to-patchstack-combines-services-to-focus-on-wordpress-plugin-and-theme-security\">rebranded to Patchstack</a> in March this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/patchstack-whitepaper-582-wordpress-security-issues-found-in-2020-over-96-from-third-party-extensions\">2020 whitepaper</a>, the security company found 582 vulnerabilities for the year. This report covers issues from both Patchstack and third-party vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, issues found in 2021 have multiplied from the previous year. <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/red-team/\">Patchstack Red Team</a>, a community bug-hunting program that pays out monthly bounties, has reported 1,182 vulnerabilities from March through October. Bounty payouts have reached $9,150 thus far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are merely the problems found through Patchstack Red Team. When combined with security issues reported through other vendors that the company tracks, the vulnerability count jumps to over 2,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need to be worried,&rdquo; said Oliver Sild, Patchstack founder and CEO, when asked how much of a problem these numbers are. &ldquo;I think we should be grateful and glad that we have ethical hackers and researchers who have been investing more of their time helping plugin developers to improve their code. From one angle, you could see a record year in terms of new vulnerabilities found, but what we see is a record year of security issues fixed in the WordPress ecosystem. The majority of these issues have been sitting there for years.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several security plugin vendors and hosting companies, including Pagely and Cloudways, are supporting the Patchstack initiative. In return, they have access to the <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/solutions/#feed\">Threat Intelligence Feed</a>, an API to warn their customers of newfound vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Patchstack is ultra-focused on plugin vulnerabilities,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we focus on and thrive to do best. Our competitive advantage is the fact that we have less features, which means less bloat and no impact on the site&rsquo;s performance. Meanwhile, we solve probably the #1 security issue in the WordPress ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is referring to third-party plugins and themes as being the primary security issue. Over 96% of the vulnerabilities in the company&rsquo;s 2020 whitepaper were from WordPress extensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October, Patchstack <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/robert-joining-patchstack-security-advocate/\">brought in Robert Rowley</a>, a former head of security at DreamHost and Pagely, in a new &ldquo;security advocate&rdquo; role. Sild said that his knowledge would bring a lot of experience to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;He will help us make Patchstack better for both hosting companies and to plugin developers,&rdquo; the CEO said. &ldquo;At the same time, he&rsquo;ll be helping us to narrow the gap between plugin devs and ethical hackers by spreading awareness and helping both sides understand each other (and challenges) better.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past week, the company released its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/patchstack/\">Patchstack plugin</a> to the WordPress directory. The free version is essentially a warning system for site owners of security issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can think about the Community (Free) version as an option for anyone in the WordPress ecosystem to be alerted about new vulnerabilities found in plugins, themes, and WordPress core,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;It comes with a central dashboard where you can add up to 99 websites for free, so you&rsquo;ll have all the analytics and alerts about security issues on all your sites in a single place.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free version does not include hotfixes or patches. Its goal is to detect issues and provide alerts. Patchstack has upgraded features in its <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/pricing/\">Pro and Business plans</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Pro comes with automatic virtual patching for those vulnerabilities which provide active protection against the vulnerabilities that are being discovered,&rdquo; said Sild. &ldquo;Business plan is great for agencies who have more than 100 sites and want to have full protection against plugin vulnerabilities on all of their websites.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sild also teased &ldquo;something very cool&rdquo; for developers and ethical hackers in the pipeline to create a more secure plugin ecosystem. However, he refrained from providing any details.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 06 Nov 2021 01:27:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Post Status: Business Names, DBAs, and Trademarks with Nellie Akalp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=88924\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://poststatus.com/business-names-dbas-and-trademarks-with-nellie-akalp/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5399:\"<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Learn about Trademarks and Doing Business As names (DBAs) for your freelancing or small business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Nellie Akalp</strong> joined <strong>Cory Miller</strong> to discuss trademarks and DBAs for small businesses.

WooCommerce has almost always seemed to lag behind all other considerations. It&rsquo;s a bit like it&rsquo;s an afterthought to simply scramble in the elements of a solid WooCommerce store. Where is a persistent cart header? Where are the templates for <code>/single-product</code>? There&rsquo;s all kinds of elements which <em>can</em> be developed right along side of other teams working on FSE, but it seems to (again, <em>consistently</em>) not happen.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve taken Blockbase and all the other FSE themes for a spin on LocalWP, and none of them have any WooCommerce elements in them. Again, one should not expect perfection at a &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; stage. However there does seem to be a behavioral pattern of WooCommerce elements being a bit of an &ldquo;afterthought&rdquo; that simply brings up the rear about a year or year-and-six-months afterwards.</p><p>Why not get everyone on the same page immediately? That way theme authors can address putting the cart elements in the header template. (Yes, WC can be run, but w/out a cart header, shoppers don&rsquo;t know where to click after an item is in their cart). And, if theme authors and WP core developers always, Always, ALWAYS started simultaneously <strong>with</strong> one or two WooCommerce folks on board, it would absolutely shorten the time needed for store owners to receive the benefits of FSE (and remove some of their pagebuilders!) and for WordPress to get more Shopify business over to WooCommerce. But that seemingly never happens because WooCommerce always seems to be the &ldquo;afterthought.&rdquo;</p><cite>Brad</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">First, I want to make sure all of our readers are on the same page. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce</a> is a third-party plugin. It is unrelated to the core WordPress and Gutenberg projects. Granted, WooCommerce is owned by Automattic, one of the largest contributors of resources and people. So, there is likely some crossover among developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still crucial that we make a distinction between the two. When looking at some of the recent block themes that other developers have released, I have yet to see any integrate with the WooCommerce plugin. I cannot say whether any of their authors have plans to do so in the future. I imagine that some will and others will not. Like with any third-party plugin that outputs something on the front-end (e.g., bbPress, Easy Digital Downloads, etc.), it is the theme author&rsquo;s choice of whether they want to take on the burden of supporting integrations with projects that are not their own. It can be a maintenance nightmare at times, particularly when it comes to free themes. However, I have no doubt that we will see more block theme authors catering to WooCommerce users as we move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this is a long-winded way of saying the responsibility of WooCommerce working in a block world is on WooCommerce itself. When it gets to that stage, theme authors will follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I love about the block system is that it creates a standard for all themes and plugins to build from. The long-term goal of plugins like WooCommerce should be to work without theme support.  If a user wants a cart item in their nav menu, it should be as simple as adding a block via the site editor. The same should be said for any other element of creating an online shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reached out to Darren Ethier, an engineering team lead within Automattic who works on the intersection between WooCommerce and Gutenberg. He agreed that the block system could make it easier for things to simply work without specialized theme support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s definitely the target we&rsquo;re shooting for,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whether or not we will land it in the first iteration is still unknown.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the answer is more complex than that. WooCommerce is a heavy plugin with a history entrenched in the pre-block era of WordPress and has an ecosystem of third-party add-ons it must be careful not to break. The team is making progress and has a few things shooting through the pipeline. It will take some time, but you will not see block themes showcasing WooCommerce shops without the plugin first laying the groundwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block templates are a high priority. Top-level templates like <code>single-product.html</code>, <code>archive-product.html</code>, <code>taxonomy-product-cat.html</code>, and <code>taxonomy-product-tag.html</code> will be available to any block-enabled theme soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This <em>initial</em> iteration will be a straight port of the existing PHP templates and have a placeholder for the rendering of the template in the editor,&rdquo; said Ethier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re essentially wrapping the rendered PHP template in a dynamic block. This is definitely <em>not</em> the end goal. It just is the initial step of moving towards our vision of &lsquo;Store Editing&rsquo; where merchants are able to completely customize the layout of their stores using all the opportunities available through the block and site editors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is more of a stopgap measure than full-blown support. However, it is a step in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We decided to take this approach because it more quickly helps bridge the gap between the current PHP-based templates and block themes so that folks can start to see the potential (and still add blocks around the PHP-rendered content),&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We also know it&rsquo;s going to be a complex job to more fully implement the vision of Store editing with block themes while supporting (and inspiring) the rich existing ecosystem of WooCommerce extensions. So, this allows us to incrementally improve things over time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may not be the news all block theme authors want to hear, but the changes will be enough for them to start exploring tighter integration with the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is currently aiming to add block template support in the next release of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> plugin. If all goes well, the feature will be ported to WooCommerce 6.0, which should be in time for the WordPress 5.9 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to set expectations, though (which is why I&rsquo;m mentioning this again),&rdquo; said Ethier. &ldquo;This initial iteration definitely will <em>not</em> be the final iteration of Woo Block templates.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also highlighted several things from the roadmap:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&ldquo;Product Element Blocks&rdquo; &ndash; which are the Woo equivalents to the WP template blocks. So, things like &ldquo;Product Title,&rdquo; &ldquo;Product Description,&rdquo; &ldquo;Add to Cart Button,&rdquo; etc.</li><li>Integrating with the WP Query Loop Block (for products).</li><li>&ldquo;Mini-Cart Block&rdquo; &ndash; which should allow for insertion into header/footer template parts.</li><li>Commerce Patterns.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All these things (and more) will help us with iterating on the various components of a store that are visually represented via templates, template parts (i.e., think of things like reviews on the single product page, etc.),&rdquo; said Ethier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper look at what is ahead, read <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2021/08/31/peek-into-the-woocommerce-blocks-roadmap/\">Peek into the WooCommerce Blocks Roadmap</a>. Warning: it is dense and geared toward developers, but it must be. The solutions for a project the size and scope of WooCommerce are not simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;One key strategy we&rsquo;re trying here is to provide default WooCommerce store editing templates and functionality out of the box with Woo Core that should in theory &lsquo;just work&rsquo; with any block theme,&rdquo; said Ethier. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much that <code>theme.json</code> and global styles unlock to make this possible. Themes will still be able to override the default WooCommerce templates and template parts if they want, but they won&rsquo;t <em>need</em> to.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may feel like block-based storefronts are lightyears away, we must remember that block themes are in their infancy. There are only about a couple dozen in the directory, and most of those are experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am as excited as anyone about what this could mean for projects like WooCommerce. At the same time, I also know that the road might be longer than what we have in mind, but the WooCommerce team is already traveling down it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Nov 2021 23:13:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:49:24 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:30:10 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}', 'no');
